Citrix Receiver for Web provides access to IT resources such as Windows apps, desktops, documents, Web apps and SaaS apps, all using the Web.

            "location": "/how-the-api-works/", 
            "text": "How the API works\n\n\nThis topic describes the behavior of the StoreFront Web API including authentication behavior, cookies, localization specifics, release compatibility and URL discovery.\n\n\nAuthentication challenge\n\n\nSome Web Proxy URLs are protected and require authentication information to allow access. If the required authentication information is not present, the Web Proxy returns an empty response (HTTP status code 200) with the following HTTP header:\n\n\nCitrixWebReceiver-Authenticate: reason=\nTokenRequired\n,\nlocation=\nAuthentication/GetAuthMethods\n\n\n\n\nThe location value in the challenge specifies a URL that the client requests (via Ajax) to determine which authentication methods are available. The challenge may contain an additional attribute \nmode=Redirect\n, which triggers the client to redirect to a 3rd party page instead to perform the authentication step.\n\n\nEven after the user has authenticated, a challenge may be returned. For example, if the user's Web Proxy session has terminated for any reason, the \nASP.NET_SessionId cookie\n is absent from the client request, or if the StoreFront credential wallet service has restarted.\n\n\nTherefore, the client must be prepared to respond to such an authentication challenge at any time by prompting the user to re-authenticate to the site.\n\n\nClient Name, Client Address and Device Id\n\n\nWhen the Web Proxy communicates with certain Store Service APIs, it supplies values for client name, client address and device id. These values are required for workspace control to function correctly. It is important that the Web Proxy passes consistent data for these parameters to all Store Services that take these parameters.\n\n\nClient name specifies the hostname of the client machine and device id specifies a value unique to the client device. Since a typical browser-based client has limited access to the client OS and cannot determine the hostname, the Web Proxy automatically generates a random string value to use for both client name and device id. This value is returned to the client as a persistent cookie, named CtxsDeviceId, in a successful response (HTTP status 200) to a resource enumeration. It is expected that this cookie is returned by the client in subsequent requests.\n\n\nClient address identifies the client IP address. This may be used on some XenApp/ XenDesktop systems to determine if a client should be presented with a particular resource. The Web Proxy automatically determines the client address from the Microsoft ASP.NET API \nHttpRequest.UserHostAddress\n, which returns the IP address of the client as seen at the web server. This may not be the actual client address; for example, if connecting through a NetScaler Gateway or other proxy server.\n\n\nIf multiple web browsers connect to a Citrix Receiver for Web site from the same client machine, a different (random) value for the CtxsDeviceId cookie is returned to each browser to represent the client name and device id. This results in the sessions being treated by the Store Services as running on separate devices. This may lead to apps disappearing and reappearing when performing session operations; for example, querying and reconnecting to sessions.\n\n\nCookies\n\n\nThe Web Proxy sets a number of cookies as outlined in the table below. The client must return the cookies in subsequent requests, as indicated by the cookie life time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCookie\n\n\nLife time\n\n\nHttpOnly\n\n\nWhen Set\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASP.NET_SessionId\n\n\nSession\n\n\nYes\n\n\nFirst response from Web Proxy\n\n\nASP.NET session id, represents the web session between client and Web Proxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtxsAuthId\n\n\nSession\n\n\nYes\n\n\nResponse indicating successful authentication\n\n\nProtects against session fixation attacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCsrfToken\n\n\nSession\n\n\nNo\n\n\nFirst response from Web Proxy\n\n\nProtects against cross- site request forgery attacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCtxsDeviceId\n\n\nPersistent, 2 years\n\n\nYes\n\n\nResponse indicating successful resource enumeration\n\n\nSpecifies the value to use for client name and device id (see above)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTTPS indicator to secure cookies\n\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the Web Proxy API requires the client to indicate whether it is using an HTTPS connection or not by supplying a header named \nX-Citrix- IsUsingHTTPS\n with value \"Yes\" or \"No\". When the value is set to \"Yes\", the Web Proxy sets the Secure attribute for all cookies that it generates to protect them from being viewed from non-HTTPS connections. This caters for NetScaler Gateway scenarios where the connection from the browser to the gateway is over HTTPS but the connection from the gateway to the internal Citrix Receiver for Web site (where the Web Proxy runs) is HTTP.\n\n\nCross-site request forgery token\n\n\nTo protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, the Web Proxy APIs require that a CSRF token be supplied by the client, unless specified otherwise. This is a random string generated by the Web Proxy for the duration of the session and communicated to the client using a session cookie. Clients must read the value of this cookie and send it back to the Web Proxy in most API calls, as either the value of a header named Csrf-Token (note the hyphen) for POST requests, or as the value of a query string parameter named CsrfToken for GET requests.\n\n\nLocalization\n\n\nGenerally, the Web Proxy does not return user-facing strings to display in a UI. However, the authentication process uses the Citrix Common Forms protocol to obtain a definition of the logon form (amongst other forms), which typically includes strings for UI controls (for example, a \"Username: \" label or \"Log On\" button). The value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header is used to determine the language for such strings. This value is also reflected back to the client in the response to the /Home/ Configuration request so that the client may perform any additional localization to match the language used for authentication forms.\n\n\nHypermedia control and parameterized URLs\n\n\nThe StoreFront Web API uses the concept of hypermedia controls. With hypermedia controls, links to resources and actions are obtained from the server, either from the client configuration (/Home/Configuration) or directly as the result of calling this API. This means that clients must never construct URLs.\nIn these topics, various parameterized URLs are discussed, such as /Resources/ Subscription/{id}. It is important to note that these are indicative only, because the client code must not construct URLs directly. Instead, all parameterized URLs must be obtained from the service itself. For example, the URL to launch a particular resource must be extracted from the JSON data returned from the request to /Resources/List/.\nIn some cases, additional parameters can be supplied to a service that is invoked by a GET HTTP request. These parameters are supplied to the service by adding query string parameters to the base service URL. Clients must not make assumptions on the form of the service URL, which may vary with different releases. In particular, clients must not make assumptions about the presence or absence of query string parameters in the base service URL and must determine in each case whether new parameters should be appended with '?' or '\n'.\n\n\nBackwards and forwards compatibility\n\n\nThis is a preliminary revision of the Web Proxy API. No guarantees are made about backwards or forwards compatibility with any previous or future releases of Citrix Receiver for Web.\n\n\nURL discovery\n\n\nWhen the JavaScript code executes in the browser, it first makes an Ajax request to the Web Proxy URL defined by the variable CTXS.configUrl (this defaults to /Home/ Configuration, but can be overridden by a JavaScript customization). This returns an XML document describing various Citrix Receiver for Web configuration settings, including a number of URL paths (relative to the site root) that the client must use for subsequent API calls. In addition to these \"fixed\" URLs, the client may later be sent additional URL paths specific to a given resource. For example, calling Resource/List returns JSON data describing all resources available to the user, including URL paths (per resource) for resource-specific operations such as launching a given resource or subscribing to a resource. These URL paths contain a resource id embedded within them.\n\n\nAPI usage pattern\n\n\nAt a high level, the client accesses the Web Proxy API by performing calls in the following order:\n\n\n\n\nFetch the site configuration, to determine behavior and discover URLs for subsequent operations\n\n\nPerform authentication, to allow access to resources\n\n\nList sessions, to perform auto session reconnect at logon\n\n\nList resources, to fetch additional (per-resource) URLs for launch and subscription operations\n\n\nLaunch and subscribe to resources in response to user actions in the UI\n\n\n\n\nHTTP POST Parameters\n\n\nThroughout the API, any request parameters in the POST body must follow standard form URL-encoding rules, with Content-Type set to:\n\n\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded",

Explicit authentication, where the user enters credentials manually, is performed using the Citrix Common Forms Protocol. See the Citrix StoreFront API documentation for more information about Common Forms authentication.\n\n\nThe client initiates a forms conversation by making a request to the Web Proxy Explicit Forms URL (returned by /Authentication/GetAuthMethods) to get the first form in a possible series of forms. The Web Proxy forwards form requests to the StoreFront Authentication service and relays replies back to the client. All forms are unmodified by the Web Proxy, with the sole exception that any post-back URLs are modified to point to Web Proxy URLs, so that the client never contacts the Authentication service directly.\n\n\nThe forms are always returned as XML, which must be parsed by the client, transformed into corresponding HTML and displayed to the user. Once the user completes and submits a form, the client posts the form data back to a post-back URL provided in the original form XML. This may result in further forms being sent to the client to solicit additional information from the user. The client continues the process of rendering and submitting forms until either an authentication success or failure response is received.\n\n\nThe client must not assume that the initial form returned represents a logon form. Typically, this is the case, but another form may be returned in certain circumstances; for example, a change password form is returned if password expiry is configured and the user's password has expired. Third parties may also use the StoreFront Authentication SDK to inject custom forms into the authentication process.\n\n\nRequest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURL (indicative only)\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nAccepts POST data\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ExplicitAuth/Login\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nNo\n\n\nRequests the first form in an explicit forms conversation. The URL is returned by / Authentication/ GetAuthMethods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/ExplicitAuth/ LoginAttempt\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAttempts an explicit logon.

The URL is returned as the CancelPostBack element in a form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the user submits a form (for example, by activating a Logon button), the client must process the user-supplied data as described in the section Processing Form Data of the document \"Citrix Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language v2.0\" in the Citrix StoreFront API documentation.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nIf the client omits to post any of the required data, the Authentication service rejects  the form, resulting in a failed logon.\n\n\nOnce the user submits a form that results in successful authentication, the StoreFront    Authentication service returns a primary authentication token for the user. All tokens,     including the primary token plus any secondary tokens that are subsequently acquired for    other StoreFront services (for example, Resources service), are held at the Web Proxy on    behalf of the user, so that the client does not need to deal with the complexities of the   authentication system.\n\n\nTokens are maintained in the Web Proxy in an ASP.NET session object, which is bound to    the user's browser session via the ASP.NET_SessionId cookie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Code\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\nSuccess or failure or an XML form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\nForbidden, due to one of the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Invalid CSRF token\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Format\n\n\nRequest Accept/Response Content-Type Header\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML\n\n\napplication/xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess Response Content\n\n\nWhen a successful response (HTTP status code 200) is returned, the response body contains an XML document where the root node is either AuthenticationStatus or AuthenticateResponse.\n\n\nAn AuthenticationStatus response indicates either success or failure and contains the following child elements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement name\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult\n\n\nYes\n\n\nValue \"success\" or \"failure\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthType\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe authentication type, indicated by one of the authentication method strings \"ExplicitForms\", \"IntegratedWindows\", \"Certificate\", \"CitrixAGBasic\", \"PostCredentials\". Only sent when authentication succeeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogMessage\n\n\nNo\n\n\nAn error id indicating the reason for the authentication failure. Typically, the generic value \"fatalerror\" is returned, but \"sessiontimeout\" is returned if the Citrix Receiver for Web session has timed out. Only sent when authentication fails.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsChangePasswordEnabled\n\n\nNo\n\n\nValue \"true\". Only sent when authentication succeeds and elective change password is enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsExpiryNotificationEnabled\n\n\nNo\n\n\nValue \"true\". Only sent when authentication succeeds, password expiry notification is enabled, and the user's password is due to expire within the configured time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeRemaining\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe time remaining (in minutes) until the user's password expires. Only sent when authentication succeeds, password expiry notification is enabled and the user's password is due to expire within the configured time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticateResponse\n is an XML description of a form that is displayed to the user to collect additional information required for the authentication operation (typically, logon on change password). See the Common Forms Authentication documentation for information about the various form elements.\n\n\nExample: Explicit Authentication\u2014Logon Form Returned\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nPOST http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/ExplicitAuth/Login HTTP/\n1.1\nHost: kontiki\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/\n20100101 Firefox/26.0\nAccept: application/xml, text/xml, */*; q=0.01\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,fr;q=0.3\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nCsrf-Token: 23E18D9002817048C931EA636E0D5C81\nX-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS: No\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nReferer: http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/\nCookie: CtxsAuthMethod=ExplicitForms;\nCsrfToken=23E18D9002817048C931EA636E0D5C81;\nASP.NET_SessionId=hdqnxu21dz3p2nb2zcfo2sfs\nConnection: keep-alive\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\nContent-Length: 0\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store\nPragma: no-cache\nContent-Type: application/\nvnd.citrix.authenticateresponse-1+xml; charset=utf-8\nExpires: -1\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/8.5\nX-Citrix-ExplicitAuthProtocol: ExplicitForms\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nX-Citrix-Application: Receiver for Web\nDate: Fri, 17 Jan 2014 16:25:09 GMT\nContent-Length: 1555\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n?\n\n\nAuthenticateResponse xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/authentication/\nresponse/1\n\n  \nStatus\nsuccess\n/Status\n\n  \nResult\nmore-info\n/Result\n\n  \nStateContext /\n\n  \nAuthenticationRequirements\n\n    \nPostBack\nExplicitAuth/LoginAttempt\n/PostBack\n\n    \nCancelPostBack\nExplicitAuth/CancelForm\n/CancelPostBack\n\n    \nCancelButtonText\nCancel\n/CancelButtonText\n\n    \nRequirements\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n    \nCredential\n\n      \nID\nusername\n/ID\n\n      \nSaveID\nExplicitForms-Username\n/SaveID\n\n      \nType\nusername\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nText\nUser name:\n/Text\n\n      \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n    \nInput\n\n      \nAssistiveText\ndomain\\user or user@domain.com\n/\nAssistiveText\n\n      \nText\n\n        \nSecret\nfalse\n/Secret\n\n        \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n        \nInitialValue\n\n        \n/InitialValue\n\n        \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n      \n/Text\n\n    \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\nCredential\n\n      \nID\npassword\n/ID\n\n      \nSaveID\nExplicitForms-Password\n/SaveID\n\n      \nType\npassword\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nText\nPassword:\n/Text\n\n      \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n    \nInput\n\n      \nText\n\n        \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n        \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n        \nInitialValue\n\n        \n/InitialValue\n\n        \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n      \n/Text\n\n    \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n    \nCredential\n\n      \nID\nsaveCredentials\n/ID\n\n      \nType\nsavecredentials\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nText\nRemember my password\n/Text\n\n      \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n    \nInput\n\n      \nCheckBox\n\n        \nInitialValue\nfalse\n/InitialValue\n\n      \n/CheckBox\n\n    \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n    \nCredential\n\n      \nID\nloginBtn\n/ID\n\n      \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n    \nInput\n\n      \nButton\nLog On\n/Button\n\n    \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n    \n/Requirements\n\n  \n/AuthenticationRequirements\n\n\n/AuthenticateResponse\n\n\n\n\nThe client transforms the XML form description into an HTML representation, which is then dynamically added to the web page DOM.

Requesting this URL initiates a Common Forms protocol conversation, in a similar way to /ExplicitAuth/ Login. If the user submits the form after entering invalid data (or omitting required data), further forms may be generated. The client must be prepared to receive multiple forms in succession and process these until either a success or failure response is received. If the password change is successful, a password confirmation form is returned; when the confirmation form is submitted a successful AuthenticationStatus response is returned. In other words, the change password conversation proceeds exactly as described in the example for the case where the user's password has expired at logon time.\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nPOST http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/Authentication/\nGetChangeCredentialForm HTTP/1.1\nHost: kontiki\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/\n20100101 Firefox/26.0\nAccept: application/xml, text/xml, */*; q=0.01\nAccept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,fr;q=0.3\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nCsrf-Token: A4BF7CB3334846575421F41AD44EBA67\nX-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS: No\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nReferer: http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/\nCookie: CtxsAuthMethod=ExplicitForms;\nCsrfToken=A4BF7CB3334846575421F41AD44EBA67;\nCtxsAuthId=910C6BFC2C98184CA57F77556041E0D3;\nASP.NET_SessionId=cxd25yc3xwq10qevwpxywyxu\nConnection: keep-alive\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\nContent-Length: 0\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store\nPragma: no-cache\nContent-Type: application/\nvnd.citrix.authenticateresponse-1+xml; charset=utf-8\nExpires: -1\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/8.5\nX-Citrix-ExplicitAuthProtocol: ExplicitForms\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nX-Citrix-Application: Receiver for Web\nDate: Mon, 20 Jan 2014 11:48:00 GMT\nContent-Length: 2097\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n?\n\n\nAuthenticateResponse xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/authentication/\nresponse/1\n\n  \nStatus\nsuccess\n/Status\n\n  \nResult\nupdate-credentials\n/Result\n\n  \nStateContext /\n\n  \nAuthenticationRequirements\n\n    \nPostBack\nExplicitAuth/SendForm\n/PostBack\n\n    \nCancelPostBack\nExplicitAuth/CancelForm\n/CancelPostBack\n\n    \nCancelButtonText\nCancel\n/CancelButtonText\n\n    \nRequirements\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n    \nCredential\n\n      \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nText\nChange Password\n/Text\n\n      \nType\nheading\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n    \nInput /\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n    \nCredential\n\n      \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nText\nEnter your old and new passwords\n/Text\n\n      \nType\ninformation\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n    \nInput /\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n    \nCredential\n\n      \nType\nusername\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nText\nUser name:\n/Text\n\n      \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n    \nInput\n\n      \nText\n\n        \nSecret\nfalse\n/Secret\n\n        \nReadOnly\ntrue\n/ReadOnly\n\n        \nInitialValue\nacmecorp\\user1\n/InitialValue\n\n        \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n      \n/Text\n\n    \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n    \nCredential\n\n      \nID\noldPassword\n/ID\n\n      \nType\npassword\n/Type\n\n    \n/Credential\n\n    \nLabel\n\n      \nText\nOld password:\n/Text\n\n      \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n    \n/Label\n\n\nInput\n\n\nText\n\n    \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n    \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n    \nInitialValue\n\n    \n/InitialValue\n\n    \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n  \n/Text\n\n\n/Input\n\n  \n/Requirement\n\n  \nRequirement\n\n\nCredential\n\n  \nID\nnewPassword\n/ID\n\n  \nSaveID\nExplicitForms-Password\n/SaveID\n\n  \nType\nnewpassword\n/Type\n\n\n/Credential\n\n\nLabel\n\n  \nText\nNew password:\n/Text\n\n  \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n\n/Label\n\n\nInput\n\n  \nText\n\n    \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n    \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n    \nInitialValue\n\n    \n/InitialValue\n\n    \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n  \n/Text\n\n\n/Input\n\n  \n/Requirement\n\n  \nRequirement\n\n\nCredential\n\n  \nID\nconfirmPassword\n/ID\n\n  \nType\nnewpassword\n/Type\n\n\n/Credential\n\n\nLabel\n\n  \nText\nConfirm password:\n/Text\n\n  \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n\n/Label\n\n\nInput\n\n  \nText\n\n    \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n    \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n    \nInitialValue\n\n    \n/InitialValue\n\n    \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n  \n/Text\n\n\n/Input\n\n  \n/Requirement\n\n  \nRequirement\n\n\nCredential\n\n  \nID\nchangePasswordBtn\n/ID\n\n  \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n\n/Credential\n\n\nLabel\n\n  \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n\n/Label\n\n\nInput\n\n \nButton\nOK\n/Button\n\n    \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n    \n/Requirements\n\n  \n/AuthenticationRequirements\n\n\n/AuthenticateResponse\n\n\n\n\nWith elective change password the user has already authenticated to Citrix Receiver for Web.

This name is then displayed in the title bar of the Desktop Viewer. Note: this is a POST parameter for GetLaunchStatus and a query string parameter for LaunchIca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nTypically, these requests require an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies  ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId. However, when the Web Proxy is configured to use an   unauthenticated Store, an authenticated session is not required.\n\n\nThe URLs given above are for illustrative purposes; the actual URLs used by a client  must be taken from the result of an earlier enumeration request to /Resources/List.\n\n\nLaunchIca is a GET instead of a POST so that it can be loaded by a browser in a hidden    iframe (using the iframe's src=\"url\" attribute) to trigger a launch via file-type   association.\n\n\nGetLaunchStatus makes a launch request to the Store Service to determine whether the  specified resource is ready to launch or not. If this returns an ICA file, the ICA file is  cached for up to 90 seconds. If a subsequent call is made to LaunchIca within this time,    the cached ICA file is returned without making an additional launch request to the Store    Service.\n\n\nFor LaunchIca, clients must append a query string key with a random value to prevent  browsers from returning a cached response when making multiple launch requests for the  same resource. See the launchId query string parameter in the examples below.\n\n\nCalling GetResourceStatus can trigger a desktop VM to start up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Code\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200\n\n\nSuccess/Retry required/failure, or authentication challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n403\n\n\nForbidden, due to one of the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Invalid CSRF token\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header (only required for the POST request)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Invalid CtxsAuthId cookie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n404\n\n\nResource identified by {id} was not known to the Web Proxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Format\n\n\nRequest Accept/Response Content-Type Header\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON\n\n\napplication/json or text/plain (see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICA File\n\n\napplication/octet-stream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess Response Content\n\n\nWhen a successful response (HTTP status code 200) for GetLaunchStatus is returned, the response body contains a JSON string describing whether the supplied resource is ready to be launched or not, with the following fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\n\nJavaScript Type\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus\n\n\nString\n\n\nYes\n\n\nOne of the following strings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* success: the resource is ready to be launched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* retry: currently, the resource is not ready to be launched (for example, a desktop VM that first needs to be powered on before a connection can be made to it), but the launch attempt may be retried later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* failure: the attempt to retrieve launch information failed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npollTimeout\n\n\nNumber\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerrorId\n\n\nString\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuggestRestart\n\n\nBoolean\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a successful response for LaunchIca is returned, the response body can be either a JSON string, as described above, for GetLaunchStatus or, if the resource is ready to launch, an ICA file. Clients typically load the LaunchIca URL into an iframe to obtain an ICA file and trigger a launch via file type association. If LaunchIca returns a JSON response instead of an ICA file, the content type is set to \"text/plain\" because Internet Explorer does not render an \"application/json\" response into the iframe document and instead prompts the user to Open or Save it. If the client is using jQuery, the JSON text response can be deserialized to a JavaScript object by calling $.parseJSON(responseData).\n\n\nExample: Successful ICA launch\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nGET http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/Resources/LaunchIca/\nQ29udHJvbGxlci5EZXNrdG9w.ica?\nCsrfToken=85E9295DFD9CF333F31F0A53B769D915\nlaunchId=13800307750\n58\ndisplayNameDesktopTitle=Desktop HTTP/1.1\nHost: kontiki\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/\n20100101 Firefox/23.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/\nxml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/\nCookie: CsrfToken=85E9295DFD9CF333F31F0A53B769D915;\nCtxsAuthId=5A0B7A991C8136CE17A0D43113C00740;\nASP.NET_SessionId=jel5evcolmhl4bcm1i31exqo\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: private, max-age=0, s-maxage=0\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream; charset=utf-8\nExpires: Tue, 24 Sep 2013 13:52:55 GMT\nLast-Modified: Tue, 24 Sep 2013 13:52:55 GMT\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/8.0\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nX-Citrix-Application: Receiver for Web\nDate: Tue, 24 Sep 2013 13:52:55 GMT\nContent-Length: 1263\n[Encoding]\nInputEncoding=UTF8\n[WFClient]\nProxyFavorIEConnectionSetting=Yes\nProxyTimeout=30000\nProxyType=Auto\nProxyUseFQDN=Off\nRemoveICAFile=yes\nTransportReconnectEnabled=On\n\n... etc. \n\n\n\n\nExample: Failed ICA launch\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nPOST http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/Resources/\nGetLaunchStatus/Q29udHJvbGxlci5Db3B5IG9mIFdvcmRQYWQz HTTP/1.1\nHost: kontiki\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/\n20100101 Firefox/23.0\nAccept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nCsrf-Token: 2730933D4A9C7EFCDA52BD89EC345DD5\nX-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS: No\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nReferer: http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/\nCookie: CsrfToken=2730933D4A9C7EFCDA52BD89EC345DD5;\nCtxsAuthId=669C20DF67B0ABC5C0E1F35451EF02A5;\nASP.NET_SessionId=jel5evcolmhl4bcm1i31exqo; AGSSOHasOccurred=;\nPasswordChangeAllowed=\nConnection: keep-alive\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\nContent-Length: 0\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store\nPragma: no-cache\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\nExpires: -1\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/8.0\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nX-Citrix-Application: Receiver for Web\nDate: Tue, 24 Sep 2013 15:49:50 GMT\nContent-Length: 77\n{\nstatus\n:\nfailure\n}\n\n\n\n\nExample: ICA launch with retry\n\n\nRequest\n\n\nPOST http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/Resources/\nGetLaunchStatus/Q29udHJvbGxlci5GaXNoY2FrZSE- HTTP/1.1\nHost: kontiki\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/\n20100101 Firefox/24.0\nAccept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nCsrf-Token: 0035B0DB846D2399576612132C95AF33\nX-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS: No\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nReferer: http://webserver/Citrix/StoreWeb/\nCookie: CsrfToken=0035B0DB846D2399576612132C95AF33;\nCtxsAuthId=421E99814A2B99CFA57BB146EE036710;\nASP.NET_SessionId=vmia5swazanokecxwjefwvub\nConnection: keep-alive\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\nContent-Length: 0\ndisplayNameDesktopTitle=Desktop+Two!\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache, no-store\nPragma: no-cache\nContent-Type: application/json\nExpires: -1\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/8.0\nX-Powered-By: ASP.NET\nX-Citrix-Application: Receiver for Web\nDate: Tue, 15 Oct 2013 16:22:51 GMT\nContent-Length: 34\n{\nstatus\n:\nretry\n,\npollTimeout\n:5}\n\n\n\n\nIcons\n\n\nUse this request to retrieve icon image data relating to one or more resources.

Only the values 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256 and 512 are supported. This value is included in the iconurl returned from an earlier enumeration request, based on the image size configured in the Citrix Receiver for Web site configuration file (defaults to 48).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nThis request requires an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies  ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId.\n\n\nA CSRF token is not required, nor is the X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header, allowing the icon  URL to be directly fetched by a browser (HTTP GET) when specified as the src for an HTML    img element.\n\n\nThe URLs above are for illustrative purposes only; the actual URLs used by a client must  be taken from the result of an earlier enumeration request, which provides a separate icon  URL for each resource.\n\n\nThe thumbprint represents the image data for the resource at the time of enumeration and  so may be different in a subsequent enumeration if the image data has changed.\n\n\nThe response image is always returned in PNG format, with the Content-Type set to image/  png.\n\n\nThe Web Proxy uses the StoreFront Resources API to obtain icon images. The image data is  cached to disk as a performance optimization by default, unless persistent caching is   disabled in the Citrix Receiver for Web configuration file.\n\n\nCaching headers are set in the response to indicate that the icon image may be cached by  the client for one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Code\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n200 (OK)\n\n\nSuccess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n304 (Not Modified)\n\n\nThe request is a 'conditional GET', indicated by the presence of an If-Modified-Since header.

Notes   Domain pass-through authentication requires the client browser to be running on   Microsoft Windows. The caller must check the client platform OS prior to initiating pass-   through authentication.  The pass-through URL is configured in IIS to be protected by Integrated Windows   Authentication (IWA). The actual authentication takes place between the browser and IIS,    transparently to Citrix Receiver for Web.  The smart card URL is configured in IIS to be accessible only via HTTPS and to require a  client certificate to be supplied by the browser.  Both pass-through and smart card authentication require that the option 'Trust requests   to the XML Service' is enabled on the back-end XenDesktop/XenApp server.  When pass-through authentication is used to authenticate to Citrix Receiver for Web, the  user's password is not available to StoreFront. For launches to work without the user   being prompted for credentials, configure Citrix Receiver as described in  http://  support.citrix.com/article/CTX133855 .

Explicit authentication, where the user enters credentials manually, is performed using the Citrix Common Forms Protocol. See the Citrix StoreFront API documentation for more information about Common Forms authentication.  The client initiates a forms conversation by making a request to the Web Proxy Explicit Forms URL (returned by /Authentication/GetAuthMethods) to get the first form in a possible series of forms. The Web Proxy forwards form requests to the StoreFront Authentication service and relays replies back to the client. All forms are unmodified by the Web Proxy, with the sole exception that any post-back URLs are modified to point to Web Proxy URLs, so that the client never contacts the Authentication service directly.  The forms are always returned as XML, which must be parsed by the client, transformed into corresponding HTML and displayed to the user. Once the user completes and submits a form, the client posts the form data back to a post-back URL provided in the original form XML. This may result in further forms being sent to the client to solicit additional information from the user. The client continues the process of rendering and submitting forms until either an authentication success or failure response is received.  The client must not assume that the initial form returned represents a logon form. Typically, this is the case, but another form may be returned in certain circumstances; for example, a change password form is returned if password expiry is configured and the user's password has expired. Third parties may also use the StoreFront Authentication SDK to inject custom forms into the authentication process.",

Notes   If the client omits to post any of the required data, the Authentication service rejects  the form, resulting in a failed logon.  Once the user submits a form that results in successful authentication, the StoreFront    Authentication service returns a primary authentication token for the user. All tokens,     including the primary token plus any secondary tokens that are subsequently acquired for    other StoreFront services (for example, Resources service), are held at the Web Proxy on    behalf of the user, so that the client does not need to deal with the complexities of the   authentication system.

The StoreFront Store  service returns the icon that best matches the requested size.  The iconurl represents image data at the point that the enumeration was performed. If     the icon for a resource subsequently changes, the URL will not point to the updated image.  However, the URL is persistent because it always points to the same icon, although it may   return 404 after the icon has been updated on the XenApp/XenDesktop server.  The subscriptionUrl is used for both subscribing to and unsubscribing from a resource,    with the operation selected by a POST parameter.",

This is inserted in the generated ICA file as the value for the Title setting. This name is then displayed in the title bar of the Desktop Viewer. Note: this is a POST parameter for GetLaunchStatus and a query string parameter for LaunchIca.      Notes   Typically, these requests require an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies  ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId. However, when the Web Proxy is configured to use an   unauthenticated Store, an authenticated session is not required.  The URLs given above are for illustrative purposes; the actual URLs used by a client  must be taken from the result of an earlier enumeration request to /Resources/List.  LaunchIca is a GET instead of a POST so that it can be loaded by a browser in a hidden    iframe (using the iframe's src=\"url\" attribute) to trigger a launch via file-type   association.  GetLaunchStatus makes a launch request to the Store Service to determine whether the  specified resource is ready to launch or not. If this returns an ICA file, the ICA file is  cached for up to 90 seconds. If a subsequent call is made to LaunchIca within this time,    the cached ICA file is returned without making an additional launch request to the Store    Service.  For LaunchIca, clients must append a query string key with a random value to prevent  browsers from returning a cached response when making multiple launch requests for the  same resource. See the launchId query string parameter in the examples below.  Calling GetResourceStatus can trigger a desktop VM to start up.",

To customize, the implementing class must override this method. The signature of this method is detailed in the appropriate interface section below.\n\n\nRunExtendedValidation\n: This property indicates whether or not StoreFront validates the returned value to ensure it is of the correct form. Because there is a performance impact associated with extended validation, only set this on during development and debugging, and ensure that extended validation is set to off in the production environment.\n\n\nReturnOriginalValueOnFailure\n: This property indicates whether or not StoreFront returns the original computed value, whenever there's an error in the customized value returned by the method. We recommend you set this property to true.\n\n\n\n\nResources customization\n\n\nUse this type of customization to modify the resource enumeration, as computed by\nStoreFront, before it is sent to the client. StoreFront calls the Modify method of the\nIEnumerationResultModifier interface with the computed resource enumeration result and a context parameter. The implementing class must override the method, modify the enumeration result and return it back to StoreFront. StoreFront then sends the modified result to the client for further processing.\n\n\nRefer to the Store Service Customization API file and the sample solution supplied with the SDK for examples of how to use this interface.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nResources customizations only take effect for Receivers using the native protocols;     customizations do not take effect for clients that access the store using legacy    protocols, such as Program Neighbourhood Agent.\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n\n\nThe custom class must implement the \nIEnumerationResultModifier\n interface.\n\n\nClass Name\n\n\nName the custom class \nEnumerationResultModifier\n.\n\n\nAssembly Name\n\n\nPlace the custom class in the \nStoreCustomization_Enumeration\n assembly.\n\n\nMethod Signature\n\n\nString \nModify\n (\nCustomizationContextData\n context, string \nvalueToModify\n)\n\n\nUse this method when you want to modify the entire resource enumeration result. All the code to customize the resource enumeration must be contained within this method.\n\n\nMethod Signature\n\n\nString \nModifySingleApp\n (\nCustomizationContextData\n context, string \nvalueToModify\n)\n\n\nUse this method when you want to modify a single resource. All the code to customize the resource enumeration must be contained within this method.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontext\n: This parameter is of type \nCustomizationContextData\n and contains a set of context data, such as device information, \nHttpContext\n, user identity, access conditions, farm details and any user access preferences. See the Store Service Customization API file for details about this type; use this as a reference to base the customization logic on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalueToModify\n: This parameter is of type string and contains the resource enumeration result, as computed by StoreFront. This string adheres to the resource enumeration result, as specified in the Store Service Customization API file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nThis method returns a string containing the resource enumeration result, as specified in the StoreFront Service API.\nThe implementing class must run all the validations against the resource enumeration result before returning it from the method.\n\n\nSessions customization\n\n\nUse this interface to modify the ICA sessions enumeration, as computed by StoreFront, before it is sent to the client. StoreFront calls the Modify method of the ISessionListModifier interface with the computed session enumeration result and a context parameter. The implementing class must override the method, modify the enumeration result, and return it back to StoreFront. StoreFront then sends the modified result to the client for further processing.\n\n\nRefer to the Store Service Customization API file and the sample solution supplied with the SDK for examples of how to use this interface.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nSessions customizations only take effect for Receivers using the native protocols; customizations do not take effect for clients that access the store using legacy protocols, such as Program Neighbourhood Agent.\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n: the custom class must implement the \nISessionListModifier\n interface.\n\n\nClass Name\n: name the custom class \nSessionListModifier\n.\n\n\nAssembly Name\n: place the custom class in the \nStoreCustomization_SessionEnumeration\n assembly.\n\n\nMethod Signature\n: string \nModify\n(\nCustomizationContextData\n context, string \nvalueToModify\n)\n\n\n\n\nUse this method to modify the session enumeration result. All the code to customize the session enumeration must be contained within this method.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontext\n: This parameter is of type CustomizationContextData. It contains a set of context data, such as device information, HttpContext, user identity, access conditions, farm details and any user access preferences. See the Store Service Customization API file for details about this type; use this as a reference on which to base customization logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalueToModify\n: This parameter is of type string and contains the session enumeration result, as computed by StoreFront; see the Store Service Customization API file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nThis method returns a string containing the session enumeration result, as specified in the StoreFront Service API. The implementing class must run all validations against the session enumeration before returning it from the method.\n\n\nICA File customization\n\n\nUse this interface to modify the content of an ICA file, as computed by StoreFront, before it is sent to the client. StoreFront calls the Modify method of the ILaunchResultModifier interface with the computed ICA file and a context parameter. The implementing class must override the method, modify the ICA file, and return it back to StoreFront. StoreFront then sends the modified file to the client for further processing.\n\n\nRefer to the Store Service Customization API file and the sample solution supplied with the SDK for examples of how to use this interface.\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n:the custom class must implement the \nILaunchResultModifier\n interface.\n\n\nClass Name\n: name the custom class \nLaunchResultModifier\n.\n\n\nAssembly Name\n: place the custom class in the \nStoreCustomization_Launch\n assembly.\n\n\nMethod Signature\n: string \nModify\n(\nCustomizationContextData\n context, string \nvalueToModify\n)\n\n\n\n\nUse this method to modify the content of the ICA file. All the code to customize the ICA file must be contained within this method.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n-\ncontext\n: This parameter is of type \nCustomizationContextData\n and contains a set of context data, such as device information, \nHttpContext\n, user identity, access conditions, farm details and any user access preferences. See the Store Service Customization API file for details about this type; use this as a reference on which to base the customization logic.\n-\nvalueToModify\n: This parameter is of type string and contains the content of ICA file as computed by StoreFront.\n\n\nReturn Value\n\n\nThis method returns a string, which forms the content of the ICA file. The implementing class must run all validations against the modified file content before returning it from the method.\n\n\nRequest customization\n\n\nUse this interface to modify a request before it is forwarded to the back-end XML services, such as the XenDesktop Delivery Controller.\n\n\nUnlike other customization points where the custom code is called after StoreFront computes the result, this customization code is called before the request is sent to the back-end XML services, after partial request processing by StoreFront. StoreFront calls the Modify method of the IInputModifier interface with a set of request parameters and a context parameter. The implementing class must override this method and can alter the value of the properties of the request parameters. StoreFront uses the modified request parameters when contacting the back-end XML services.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe Request Customization interface cannot be used if the site is configured with multi-    site farms (configured using the \nuserFarmMappings\n configuration element or \nSet-  DSUserMappings\n cmdlet).\n\n\n\n\nRefer to the Store Service Customization API file and the sample solution supplied with the SDK for examples of how to use this interface.\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n: the custom class must implement the \nIInputModifier\n interface.\n\n\nClass Name\n: name the custom class \nIInputModifier\n.\n\n\nAssembly Name\n: place the custom class in the \nStoreCustomization_Input\n assembly.\n\n\nMethod Signature\n: void \nModify\n (\nCustomizationContextData\n context, out \nFarmSetsContext farmSetsContext\n, out \nDeviceInfo deviceInfo\n, out \nAccessConditions accessConditions\n)\n\n\n\n\nUse this method to modify the request. All the code to modify the request must be contained within this method.\n\n\nRefer to the Store Service Customization API file and the sample solution supplied with the SDK for examples of how to use this interface.\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n: the custom class must implement the IInputModifier interface.\n\n\nClass Name\n: name the custom class IInputModifier.\n\n\nAssembly Name\n: place the custom class in the StoreCustomization_Input assembly.\n\n\nMethod Signature\n: void Modify (CustomizationContextData context, out FarmSetsContext farmSetsContext, out DeviceInfo deviceInfo, out AccessConditions accessConditions)\n\n\n\n\nUse this method to modify the request. All the code to modify the request must be contained within this method.\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\ncontext\n: This parameter is of type \nCustomizationContextData\n. It contains a set of context data, such as device information, \nHttpContext\n, user identity, access conditions, farm details and any user access preferences.\n\n\nfarmSetsContext\n: This parameter is of type \nFarmSetsContext\n and contains the list of farms which will be contacted by StoreFront. The customization modifies this list. StoreFront contacts each farm in the modified list.\n\n\ndeviceInfo\n: This parameter is of type \nDeviceInfo\n and contains the client device information as sent by the client. Use this customization to modify this information before StoreFront sends it to the back-end XML services.\n\n\naccessConditions\n: This parameter is of type \nAccessConditions\n. It contains the access conditions sent by the client and computed by StoreFront. Use this customization to modify these conditions before StoreFront sends this information to the back-end XML services.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the parameters, see the Store Service Customization API file.\n\n\nDeploy customizations\n\n\nThis topic explains how to deploy your customizations. Customization modules must be contained within their respective assemblies. To deploy customizations:\n\n\n\n\nBack up the original assemblies\n\n\nDeploy customizations\n\n\n\n\nThese steps are explained in more detail below.\n\n\nBack up the original assemblies\n\n\nCitrix recommends you back up the original assemblies before replacing them with the new customized assemblies. Original assemblies are required for restoring the default behavior. Ensure you back up the following:\n\n\n\n\nStoreCustomization_Enumeration.dll\n\n\nStoreCustomization_Input.dll\n\n\nStoreCustomization_Launch.dll\n\n\nStoreCustomization_SessionEnumeration.dll\n\n\n\n\nDeploy customizations\n\n\nTo deploy customizations, manually copy the new customized assemblies to the Store's bin folder on the appropriate StoreFront server. This replaces the existing assemblies.\n\n\nIf the StoreFront server is part of a cluster deployment, perform the propagation action to push the new assemblies to other members of the cluster.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOnly these files, and accompanying pdbs, are propagated using the propagation action. If    there are additional files, these must be copied manually to all machines in the cluster.\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following example shows how to locate the Store's bin folder on the StoreFront Server.\n\n\nIn this example, the home directory for the website is \nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\n.\n\n\nStoreFront is configured on this website with a store named \"Store\". The valid full directory path you copy new customized assemblies to is:\n\n\nC:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Citrix\\Store\\bin\n\n\nRestart services\n\n\nAfter deploying your customizations, restart the following services. Restarting forces the services to clear any cached data from previous implementations of the assemblies.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nServices should restart automatically when customizations are deployed, but Citrix  recommend you check that this has occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternet Information Service: this is the IIS service running on the StoreFront Server.\n\n\nCitrixSubscriptionsStore\n: this is a Windows service running on the StoreFront Server.\n\n\n\n\nTest and debug\n\n\nThis topic explains how to test and debug your customizations. It explains how to enable tracing, and attach the debugger so that you can debug within Visual Studio.\n\n\nTo troubleshoot your implementation, first look in the event log. You can also consult the trace which provides more information than in the event log. During testing, set the trace level to \"verbose\"; in production, set it to Error or Warning\u2014see the section below for details of how to enable tracing.\n\n\nFor information on debugging your implementation within Visual Studio, see the section below.\n\n\nYou can also configure StoreFront to run extended validation against returned values during development and testing. To do this, set RunExtendedValidation to true; for more information see \nCustomization interfaces\n. However, because there is a performance impact when running extended validation, ensure you set this off in the production environment.\n\n\nEnable tracing\n\n\nThe tracing feature writes detailed information to the trace. The default location for trace dumps is \nC:\\Program Files\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Admin\\trace\n.\n\n\nTo enable tracing and set the trace level, use the PowerShell script \nSetDSStoreCustomizationTraceLevel.ps1\n which is supplied with the SDK. This script takes the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nSiteId\n: the IIS Site Id where the store is deployed\n\n\nVirtualPath\n: the virtual path of the store\n\n\nTraceLevel\n: use to set the following trace levels:\n    a.  \nError\n\n    b.  \nInfo\n\n    c.  \nOff\n\n    d.  \nVerbose\n\n    e.  \nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nCitrix recommend you set the trace level to \nVerbose\n during development, and to \nError\n or     \nWarning\n in theproduction environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you do not know the SiteId and VirtualPath of the Store, run the following PowerShell    commands:\n\n\n\n\ncd 'c:\\program files\\Citrix\\Receiver Storefront\\Scripts'. \n.\\ImportModules.ps1\nGet-DSStoreFeatureInstances\n\n\n\n\nWrite to the trace\n\n\nThe Store Customization SDK includes a tracing class named \nTracer\n. This class has the following methods which allow you to output to the trace from the Store Customization SDK:\n- \nTraceWarning\n: writes a warning trace message at \nTraceEventType.Warning\n\n- \nTraceInfo\n: writes an informational trace message at \nTraceEventType.Information\n\n- \nTraceError\n: writes an error trace message at \nTraceEventType.Error\n\n- \nTrace Method\n: writes a trace message at \nTraceEventType.Verbose\n\n\nDebugging\n\n\nThis section explains how to attach the debugger so that you can debug your implementation line-by-line within Visual Studio, and specify breakpoints where execution of the code pauses.\n\n\n\n\nOpen your customized solution in Visual Studio 2012.\n\n\nAttach to process w3wp.exe which has the user name \nIIS APPPOOL\\Citrix Delivery Services Resources\n.\n\n\n\n\nSubsequent requests for resources using the preferred client will hit a breakpoint in Visual Studio.\n\n\nTo set up remote debugging, see Enabling Remote Debugging. You need to do this if the development machine running Visual Studio is different from the StoreFront deployment machine running your customizations.",

            "text": "Authentication Software Development Kit\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n\n1.1  Scope\n\n\nThis document describes the StoreFront Services v2.6 Authentication Software Development Kit. It describes how to use the SDK to develop new custom forms-based authentication methods, or new authentication protocols. This document also describes how the customizations can be delivered and deployed on existing servers running StoreFront Services v2.6.\n\n\nThe SDK requires a working knowledge of the Microsoft .NET Framework (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/vstudio/aa496123 ) and in particular the C# programming language (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/z1zx9t92(v=vs.100).aspx ). \n\n\n1.2  Deliverables\n\n\nThis SDK contains the following deliverables, packaged into a single compressed archive:\n\n\n\n\nAssemblies: The external and StoreFront assemblies referenced by the samples, including any associated xml documentation files\n\n\nDocumentation: This document and its supporting documentation\n\n\nInstallers: Pre-built installers for the samples\n\n\nMerge: Files used by the sample unittests\n\n\nTools: The tools used to build the samples and run the unit tests\n\n\nMagic Word Sample: A simple authentication form that demonstrates a full implementation\n\n\nTest Forms: A sample to demonstrate the use of User Interface Elements in a series of custom forms\n\n\nCertificateIdentityDeclaration: A sample to illustrate a new authentication protocol\n\n\n\n\nThe samples contain Visual Studio 2012 solutions, C# source code that builds msi installers that can be used to deploy the sample to a StoreFront 2.6 deployment. The samples also contain unit tests focussed around testing the form implementation, or the authentication protocol.\n\n\n1.2.1   PREREQUISITES\n\n\nThe following prerequisites are required, installed in the following order:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Studio (2012 or later)\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows Server 2012 and later .NET 3.5 SP1 will need to be installed in order to be able to target .Net 3.5 SP1 as required for some project types.\n\n\nTo run the unit tests, the NUnit Test Adapter for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 is required. See the following for installation and usage instructions: http://nunit.org/index.php?p=vsTestAdapter\nr=2.6.2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWix v3.6.3303.0: http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/93929 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3  References\n\n\n[1] RFC 2617 HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617 \n\n\n[2] CitrixAuth Authentication Scheme v2.0\n\n\n[3] Security Token Services API v2.0\n\n\n[4] Citrix Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language v2.6\n\n\n[5] ASP.Net MVC 4: http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc4 \n\n\n[6] The Service Locator Pattern: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648968.aspx \n\n\n[7] Authenticode: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537359(v=vs.85).aspx\n\n\n[8] Time Stamping Authenticode Signatures: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb931395(v=vs.85).aspx \n\n\n[9] StoreFront Authentication Form Generation v2.6\n\n\n2  StoreFront Services Authentication Overview\n\n\n2.1   Identity Management Systems\n\n\nTraditional systems have centralized identity management systems where each application is responsible for authenticating the user and establishing their identity. This has led to multiple implementations of authentication and authorization systems and applications with differing levels of support for different authentication methods. \nIn federated systems the user authenticates once, to an appropriate authentication service, which gathers information about the user. This information often takes the form of assertions or claims regarding the user. The claims are then marshalled to other applications or services that rely on the authentication service. These \"relying parties\" have been configured to trust the assertions/claims issued by the authentication service, or \"trusted issuer\" and this is commonly enforced by strong cryptographic means such as digital signing and encipherment. The assertions/claims are marshalled as security tokens that are issued by the trusted issuer, held by the application, and presented to other services to gain access to data and services.\n\n\n\n2.2  The Authentication Service\n\n\nThe StoreFront Authentication Service is a web application, hosted in IIS, which makes extensive use of the ASP.NET MVC Framework 4.0 [5]. The service is usually hosted at the relative URL: /Citrix/Authentication of the chosen IIS web site. HTTP requests are routed by IIS, ASP.NET and the MVC framework to Controllers for processing.\n\n\nNew authentication methods are added by adding new ASP.NET Routes into the web application and mapping them to new Controllers. For forms based authentication, the forms are rendered using a custom mechanism based on ASP.Net Razor templates [9].\nConfiguration data is stored in the associated web.config file. When the web application starts, a configured set of start-up modules are run, which parse the configuration into settings objects that are stored in a Service Locator [6], along with other long-lived objects.\n\n\n\n\nThe StoreFront Administration Console utilizes a PowerShell layer to configure the solution. The PowerShell layer makes extensive use of a custom configuration provider that allows certain portions of the web.config file to be accessed as if it were a mounted drive; see Section 3.4.3. This simplifies accessing the configuration data using standard PowerShell commands.\n\n\n2.3  Authentication Support Services\n\n\nIn addition to the Authentication web application, there are additional Windows services that provide functionality requiring higher levels of privilege. The Authentication web application communicates with these WCF services utilizing named pipes for the communication channel. Access to these services is controlled through membership of local Windows groups.\n\n\nCredential Wallet\n\nThe Credential Wallet is a WCF service hosted in a Windows service called Citrix Credential Wallet, or its localized variant. The hosted Credential Wallet service is an in-memory hash table that securely stores encrypted passwords.\nThe samples demonstrate how to store passwords in the Credential Wallet by utilizing the existing functionality in one of the specialized claims.\n\n\nDomain Services\n\nThe Domain Services host WCF services that provide the functionality to authenticate a user by using explicit credentials  (user name and password), or utilizing Kerberos Service-for-User for both user principal names and certificates.\n\n\nThe default is to create one Domain Services called Citrix Default Domain Services, or the localized variant, which provides authentication and LDAP services for the domain that the server is currently a member of, or an associated trust scope.\nThe samples demonstrate how to delegate credential validation to the most appropriate service described above.\n\n\n2.4  Relying Party Authentication: CitrixAuth\n\n\nAs described above, a relying party, such as the Store service, can challenge for authentication at any point. This challenge takes the form of an RFC2617 [1] extension. It uses the standard HTTP WWW-Authenticate header for the challenge and the Authorization HTTP header as the response. Further information can be found in the CitrixAuth Scheme document [2].\n\n\nWhen a client receives a challenge, it must respond by constructing and sending a Request Security Token (RST) to the location specified in the challenge. The details of how to construct the RST can be found in the CitrixAuth Authentication Scheme document [2]. The client should expect to receive a Request Security Token Response (RSTR) message in response to the RST message. The location to which the RST is sent, will be the Token Issuing Service. The RSTR that is returned will contain the security token that can be used to access the required resource in the response to the challenge, plus additional information to assist the client with caching the token.\nFor more information on the endpoints and expected messages, see the Security Token Services API document [3].\n\n\n2.5  Primary Authentication\n\n\nThe Token Issuing Service is itself a relying party that issues challenges if an appropriate security token is not present. The location associated with the challenge is the protocol choices endpoint that allows a negotiation between the client and the authentication service regarding which authentication method should be used.\n\n\n\n\nThe following protocols are supported in this version:\n- User name and password: A user is required to explicitly provide their domain-qualified user name and password\n\n\n\n\nDomain pass-through: Use the desktop session credentials to authenticate\n\n\nSmart card: Smart card authentication\n\n\nHttp Basic: This is used by third-party client integrations and web portals, where an external user interface has been used to capture a domain-qualified user name and password\n\n\nPass-through from Citrix Access Gateway: This allows single sign-on from Citrix NetScaler Gateway\n\n\nCitrix Federation: This is an internal authentication mechanism to StoreFront\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cUser name and password\u201d authentication method shares a common mechanism with Access Gateway to render a form for the collection of user credentials. Further details can be found in the Common Authentication Forms Language document [4].\n\n\n2.6  Common Forms\n\n\nThe samples illustrate developing custom forms-based protocols that are based on the Common Authentication Forms Language. The flow of forms and responses constitutes a conversation that can have state associated with the overall conversation. For maximum interoperability, the protocol is a REST API (XML Forms transmitted over HTTPS) and is described in [4].\n\n\nIn this version of the SDK, a new protocol identifier is defined: CustomForms. The clients are required to recognize this protocol identifier and map it to their existing Common Forms rendering. Clients will give preference to this new protocol over the existing ExplicitForms protocol, should both be available. The expectation is that any organization will only implement, or purchase, a single custom authentication mechanism for their organization, so multiple vendors advertising their customizations in this way should not be an issue.\n\n\n2.7  Delegated Forms Authentication\n\n\nIn order to extend the reach of any customization to include NetScaler Gateway, Citrix has defined a protocol for delegating forms authentication to a customized StoreFront deployment. In this release, the StoreFront Authentication Service provides an endpoint for NetScaler to delegate the rendering and handling of forms authentication to StoreFront.\n\n\nIt is possible to configure the Delegated Forms Server to use customized forms conversations created with this SDK, allowing both internal and external clients to share the customized experience.\nIn this release, the delegated forms functionality is configured from PowerShell only. A description of the high-level commands can be found in the document installed on the StoreFront server at the following location:\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Management\\Cmdlets\\DFAServerFPReadMe.rtf\nIt is expected that the PowerShell required to configure the delegated forms to use the specific customization shall be wrapped in a simple PowerShell command by the customization author and provided as part of the customization.\n\n\n3  StoreFront Management Overview\n\n\nThe deployment and management of StoreFront is based around PowerShell and a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that orchestrates the PowerShell commands. The following sections describe where management data is stored and managed.\n\n\n3.1  Registry\n\n\nThe Windows registry is used to store the following information:\n\n\nKey\n: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServices\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\nAdminConsoleOperationMode: This controls the operational mode of the StoreFront Administration Console\n\n\nCertificateStoreName: The name of the private machine certificate store used by StoreFront\n\n\nClockSkew: The amount of clock skew allowed when comparing validity periods for authentication tokens\n\n\nConfigurationLevel: This value is used to compare two servers when replicating data\n\n\nFrameworkControllerAssemblyPath: The path of an assembly that implements the StoreFront framework controller\n\n\nFrameworkControllerType: The type of the class that implements the framework controller in the assembly at: FrameworkControllerAssemblyPath\n\n\nIISAssemblyPath: The path of an assembly that implements the IIS manager\n\n\nIISManagerType: The type of the class that implements the IIS manager in the assembly at: IISAssemblyPath\n\n\nInstallDir: The path where StoreFront is installed, which is usually: %PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\n\n\nWindowsInstallerAssemblyPath: The path of an assembly that implements the StoreFront Windows installer functionality\n\n\nWindowsInstallerType: The type of the class that implements the Windows installer functionality in the assembly at: WindowsInstallerAssemblyPath\n\n\n\n\nKey\n: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServices\\FrameworkControllerData\n\n\nValues\n\n- DirectoryPath: The path to the directory that stores the StoreFront framework controller data\n\n\nKey\n: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServicesManagement\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\nAdminMscFileLocation: The StoreFront Management Console snap-in configuration file\n\n\nInstallDir: The StoreFront management installation directory, which is usually: %PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Management\n\n\n\n\nThe following key contains sub-keys that control the scope nodes in the StoreFront Administration Console (see Section 3.5):\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServicesManagement\\Plugins\n\n\nEach key can contain the following values:\n\n\n\n\nIsEnabled: This controls whether the associated scope node is displayed\n\n\nIsFirstUsePlugin: Determines whether the associated node participates in the First-Time Use experience\n\n\nOrderingHint: This controls the order in which the scope nodes are displayed in the StoreFront Administration Console\n\n\nParent: This specifies the parent of the associated scope node\n\n\n\n\nThe Windows registry is also used by the Authentication SDK. The following key contains two sub-keys: Extensions and ViewExtensions:\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServicesManagement\\Plugins\\Authentication\nEvery authentication method should add a sub-key to the Extensions key, with a default value that specifies the assembly that contains the implementation of the Authentication SDK management plug-in as described in Section 3.5.\nIf an authentication method has configuration actions, then it should also add a sub-key to the ViewExtensions key, with a default value that specifies the assembly that contains the implementation of the Authentication SDK view extension as described in Section 3.5.3.\nThe assemblies described above should be located at the path specified by the InstallDir value of the key:\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServicesManagement.\n\n\n3.2  Framework Controller Data\n\n\nThe StoreFront framework controller data for this release is stored in an XML file at the path specified by the DirectoryPath value of the key: \nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServices\\FrameworkControllerData.\n\n\nThis file contains the information about which features are currently deployed, including Windows Services, web applications etc, and is used by the StoreFront Framework controller for deployment management.\nThe data stored here is managed by the PowerShell API and should not be manually updated.\n\n\n3.3  Configuration Data\n\n\nMost of the configuration data for individual StoreFront components is stored in the web.config file of the associated web application, or in the application.config file for Windows services.\n\n\nThese configuration settings are managed by the StoreFront Configuration Provider (see Section 3.4.3) . In order for the configuration provider to read and write the settings a configuration section is required; see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/2tw134k3(v=vs.100).aspx.\n\n\n3.3.1   SERVICE LOCATOR\n\n\nThe basic idea behind a service locator is to have an object that knows how to get hold of all of the services that an application might need. StoreFront makes extensive use of service location and inversion-of-control (IoC) containers; see http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html for more details of this software pattern.For the StoreFront services to access the configuration data the following procedure is often followed:\n1.Create a configuration section.\n2.Create a simple data class that holds all the required settings.\n3.Create a parser class that takes a configuration sections and creates a settings data object.\n4.Create a start-up module that uses the parser to create an instance of the settings object in the service locator.\n5.Obtain access to the settings objects, where required, through the service locator.\n\n\n3.3.2   START-UP MODULES\n\n\nA start-up module for a web application is a class that implements the following interface:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Mvc\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// Interface implemented by modules for executing code during the\n    /// application startup.\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public interface IStartupModule\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// The Initialize method of each registered component is called\n        /// at application startup (MvcCoreWebApplication).\n        /// Throwing an exception stop the application startup.\n        /// \n/summary\n \n        void Initialize();\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Registers components (put all registration here unless a component                  \n        /// requires registering before/after other components).\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        void RegisterComponents();\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Registers components (pre call to allow for components that must\n        /// be registered first).\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        void PreRegisterComponents();\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Registers components (pre call to allow for components that must\n        /// be registered last, don't use unless required).\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        void PostRegisterComponents();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis interface is defined in the assembly: AuthSDK.zip/Assemblies/StoreFront/ Citrix.DeliveryServices.Mvc.dll.\nStart-up modules are registered with the service locator through the configuration in the configuration file. The following illustrates registering the forms protocol start-up module:\n\n\nconfiguration\n\n  \ncontainer\n\n    \ncomponents\n\n      \ncomponent id=\nformsProtocolStartupModule\n\n                 type=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.\n                       FormsProtocol.Startup.FormsProtocolStartupModule,\n                       Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.FormsProtocol\n\n                 service=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Mvc.IStartupModule,\n                          Citrix.DeliveryServices.Mvc\n /\n\n    \n/components\n\n  \n/container\n\n  \ncitrix.deliveryservices\n\n  \n/citrix.deliveryservices\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\nDuring the start-up of the web application, all the start-up modules are discovered. The Initialize() is called first on all the modules, followed by: PreRegisterComponents(), then RegisterComponents(), and finally PostRegisterComponents().\nDuring an appropriate phase, settings and other objects can be added to the IoC container. See the samples for examples of how start-up modules are created and used.\n\n\n3.4  PowerShell Scripting\n\n\nThe StoreFront Administration Console internally uses PowerShell to perform its tasks, and administrators can use the PowerShell commands directly from a PowerShell command window or in scripts. The PowerShell support is divided into three parts: utility scripts, PowerShell modules, and the StoreFront configuration provider.\n\n\n3.4.1   UTILITY SCRIPTS\n\n\nThe StoreFront utility scripts can be found at:\n\n\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Scripts\n\n\nThe scripts include:\n- ImportModules.ps1: This performs the following tasks, to facilitate calling the StoreFront PowerShell API\n    - Adds all registered PowerShell snap-ins, with names matching the pattern: Citrix.DeliveryServices.\n, except for the StoreFront Configuration Provider\n    - Adds all PowerShell modules (\n.psm1) found in the directory specified by the InstallDir value of the registry key: HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServicesManagement\n- ClearUp_1.ps1: This removes all the StoreFront Feature instances, and can be used to cleanup after a failed uninstall of StoreFront\n- ClearUp_2.ps1: This removes all the StoreFront Feature classes, and must be called after ClearUp_1. After successfully running ClearUp_1 and ClearUp_2, StoreFront can be uninstalled using the Add/Remove Programs.\n\n\n3.4.2   POWERSHELL MODULES\n\n\nThe StoreFront PowerShell modules can be found at:\n\n\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Management\\Cmdlets\n\n\nThe commands relating to authentication are in the AuthenticationModule.psm1 module, and include the following:\n\n\n\n\nGet-DSAuthenticationProtocolsAvailable: Get the current list of available authentication protocols.\n\n\nGet-DSAuthenticationProtocolsDeployed: Get the list of protocols deployed for the Authentication service, specified by the IIS site identifier and virtual path of the associated web application.\n\n\nSet-DSAuthenticationProtocolsDeployed: Update the protocols deployed for the Authentication service, specified by the IIS site identifier and virtual path of the associated web application. The required protocols are specified in a list. Protocols not currently deployed are added, and protocols that are currently deployed but not included in the list are removed.\n\n\nAdd-DSAuthenticationProtocolsDeployed: Add the specified list of protocols to the Authentication service, specified by the IIS site identifier and virtual path of the associated web application. \n\n\nRemove-DSAuthenticationProtocolsDeployed: Remove the specified list of protocols from the Authentication service, specified by the IIS site identifier and virtual path of the associated web application.\n\n\n\n\nFull help for the commands can be obtained using the standard Get-Help command as described here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176848.aspx.\n\n\n3.4.3   STOREFRONT CONFIGURATION PROVIDER\n\n\nThe actual getting and setting of configuration properties is achieved using the StoreFront Configuration Provider. The provider exposes parts of configuration files as hierarchical namespaces, in the same way that file systems are hierarchical namespaces, comprised of directories that contain files and other directories. This is available for all web.config and service.config files.\nIn general examples of how to modify the configuration settings can be found in the StoreFront PowerShell modules described in Section 3.4.2 Alternatively a namespace can be opened and browsed, as described below, to find appropriate settings.\n\n\nThe five steps in using the StoreFront Configuration Provider are:\n\n\n1 Open a web application configuration file\n\n\nThe following illustrates how to open a drive for the authentication service in the default tenant:\n\n\n# Load the StoreFront snap-ins and modules\n\n \n$Env:PROGRAMFILES\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Scripts\\ImportModules.ps1\n\n# Get the authentication service web app for the default tenant\n$authWebApp = Get-DSAuthenticationServiceWebApp\n# Get the configuration for the web app\n$appPath = GetAppPathWeb -SiteId $authWebApp.SiteId `\n                         \u2013VirtualPath $authWebApp.VirtualPath -Name \nDSAuth\n\n$appConfig = Get-Item $appPath\ncd $appPath\n\n\n\n\n2 Open a Windows service configuration file\n\n\nConfiguring Windows services is unlikely to be necessary. However, if required, then the site name is needed to identify the service to be configured. The following site names are valid for the specified Windows service name:\n- Citrix Credential Wallet: CredentialWallet\n- Citrix Subscriptions Store: SubscriptionsStoreService\n- Citrix Default Domain Services: DefaultDomainService\n- Citrix Peer Resolution Service: PNRS\n- Citrix StoreFront Protocol Transition: ProtocolTransitionService\n\n\nThe following illustrates how to open a drive for the Credential Wallet.\n\n\n# Load the StoreFront snap-ins and modules\n\n \n$Env:PROGRAMFILES\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Scripts\\ImportModules.ps1\n\n$driveName = \nCW\n\n$siteName = \nCredentialWallet\n\n$cwDrive = GetAppPath -AppPath $siteName -Name $driveName\n$cwAppConfig = Get-Item $cwDrive\ncd $cwDrive\n\n\n\n\n3 Access data\n\n\nThe majority of the settings are in the /DeliveryServices namespace, which can be navigated and explored using the standard dir, or ls alias. For example, the following enumerates all the namespaces in a default authentication service:\n\n\nPS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\n ls | select { $_.PSPath }\n $_.PSPath\n-----------\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\citrixFederationAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\formsProtocol\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\authentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\routing\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\delegatedKerberosAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\defaultRoutes\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\delegatedExplicitAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\commonExplicitEndpoints\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\certificateManager\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\authenticationService\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\cryptography\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\tokenManager\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\windowsEventLogger\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\logger\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\credentialWalletClient\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\delegatedDirectoryClaimFactory\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\localisation\n\n\n\n\nThe standard Get-Item and Get-ItemProperty commands can be used to access the properties. For example, the following illustrates displaying the explicit business logic settings:\n\n\nPS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\n Get-ItemProperty DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\nPSPath                      : DeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\nPSParentPath                : DeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\nPSChildName                 : explicitBL\nPSDrive                     : DSAuth\nPSProvider                  : DeliveryServices\nAuthenticatorName           : defaultDelegatedAuthenticator\nRequireAccountSIDs          : True\nHideDomainField             : True\nAllowUserPasswordChange     : Never\nShowPasswordExpiryWarning   : Windows\nPasswordExpiryWarningPeriod : 10\nAllowZeroLengthPassword     : False\n\n\n\n\nThe following illustrates how to set a variable to determine whether or not the domain field is displayed in the explicit logon form:\n\n\nPS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\n $showDomainField = -not` \n                          (Get-Item DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\\HideDomainField)\nPS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\n $showDomainField\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n4 Set data\n\n\nThe configuration settings can be modified using the standard Set-Item and Set-ItemProperty commands. However, StoreFront also has a command to set multiple properties simultaneously. For example, the following sets the password expiry warning notice to be five days irrespective of any Windows policy:\n\n\nSetItemProperties `\n   -Path ${appPath}DeliveryServices\\explicitBL `\n   -Values @{ \nShowPasswordExpiryWarning\n = \nCustom\n; `\n              \nPasswordExpiryWarningPeriod\n = 5 }\n\n\n\n\n5 Save and close a configuration file\n\n\nThe setting of properties above does not commit the changes to the configuration file. The following demonstrates how to save the modified configuration, and to close the associated namespace.\n\n\n# Save the modified configuration\n$appConfig.Save()\n# Close the associated namespace\nRemoveDeliveryServicesDrive -Name \nDSAuth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to close the associated namespace when managing the associated configuration is complete.\n\n\nFor web applications, saving the configuration will result in the configuration being automatically reloaded. However, for Windows services, the associated service must be manually restarted, using the Restart-DSService command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5  Authentication Management SDK\n\n\nThe Authentication SDK also contains mechanisms for extending the StoreFront Administration Console. The programming elements associated with the Microsoft Management Console can be found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms692747(v=vs.85).aspx.\nThe StoreFront Administration console is composed of extensible scope nodes, one of which represents the Authentication Service. The authentication scope node has a number of extension points that are described below. In order for the StoreFront Administration Console to find the extension assemblies, the installation process should update the StoreFront registry as described in Section 3.1.\n\n\n3.5.1   DISPLAY STATUS MESSAGES\n\n\nThe Authentication scope node has an API that is used to obtain status messages from each of the authentication protocols, and each authentication method must contain an implementation of the following interface.\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.Authentication.Extensions.Interfaces\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// The authentication extension interface\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public interface IAuthenticationExtension\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Get the status messages associated with this authentication method,\n        /// to be displayed in the StoreFront administration console.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe list of status messages.\n/returns\n\n        IList\nStatusMessage\n GetStatusMessages();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis interface is defined in the assembly: AuthSDK.zip/Assemblies/StoreFront/ Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.Authentication.Extensions.Interfaces.dll.\nAny installation process should place the assembly implementing this interface in the following directory:\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Management\n\n\n3.5.2   INCLUDE CUSTOMIZATION IN ADD/REMOVE METHODS\n\n\nIn order for the Authentication node \u201cAdd/Remove methods\u201d action to display the custom authentication method, several steps are required. The Feature package definition file must contain the authProtocol properties as described in Section 4.2. In particular, the authProtocolLocalizer must define an object that implements the following interface, which allows the StoreFront Administration Console to display a localized name for the authentication method:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.Authentication.Extensions.Interfaces\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// This interface defines an object to allow external objects to\n    /// localise authentication strings\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public interface IAuthenticationLocalizer\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Get the string with the specified key from the authentication localizer\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nkey\nThe key to the string\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ncultureInfo\nThe current UI culture\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe specified string, or the key\n/returns\n\n        string GetResource(string key, CultureInfo cultureInfo);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis interface is defined in the assembly: AuthSDK.zip/Assemblies/StoreFront/ Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.Authentication.Extensions.Interfaces.dll.\n\n\n3.5.3   ADD ACTIONS\n\n\nIf an authentication protocol requires to add Actions or Overview items to the StoreFront Administration Console user interface, then a class implementing the following interface is required.\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.SnapIn.Interfaces.Plugin\n{\n    public interface IPluggableScopeNodeViewExtension\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// In dervied classes, initializes the object state\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        void InitializeViewExtension(IPluggableScopeNodeView scopeNodeView);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// In derived classes, gets a list of the actions pertinent to\n        /// the selected view Context\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        IList\nActionsPaneItemWrapper\n GetViewExtensionActions();\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// In derived classes, gets a list of the items to be\n        /// displayed under overview list\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        IList\nKeyValueListItem\n GetExtensionOverviewItems();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis interface is defined in the assembly: AuthSDK.zip/Assemblies/StoreFront/ Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.SnapIn.Interfaces.dll.\nActions are usually implemented by a wrapper invoking a PowerShell command that is part of a PowerShell module supplied as part of the customization. Any installation process should place the PowerShell module in the following directory, where it will be automatically loaded during the StoreFront Administration Console initialization procedure:\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Management\\Cmdlets\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nAny issues with the PowerShell module can prevent the StoreFront Administration Console from loading\n\n\nThe PowerShell module must be digitally signed by a trusted publisher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen an authentication method has been updated as a result of an Action, then it must signal this by issuing a  Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.Authentication.Extensions.Interfaces.Events. ExtensionChangedEvent event so that the Authentication scope node can be refreshed to reflect any changes.\n\n\n3.6  Diagnostics\n\n\n3.6.1   TRACING\n\n\nStoreFront uses the standard .NET tracing mechanism; for more information see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.trace(v=vs.110).aspx.\nStoreFront uses standard .NET trace sources; for more information see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228984(v=vs.110).aspx.\nThe trace sources are configured in the associated configuration file, for example:\n\n\n  \nsystem.diagnostics\n\n\n    \n!\u2014Trace sources --\n\n    \nsources\n\n      \nsource name=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.FormsProtocol\n\n        \nlisteners\n\n          \nadd name=\ncitrixTraceListener\n /\n\n        \n/listeners\n\n      \n/source\n\n      \nsource name=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.FormsEngine\n\n        \nlisteners\n\n          \nadd name=\ncitrixTraceListener\n /\n\n        \n/listeners\n\n      \n/source\n\n\n    \n!\u2014Trace switches --\n\n    \nswitches\n\n      \nadd name=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.FormsProtocol\n value=\nError\n /\n\n      \nadd name=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.FormsEngine\n value=\nError\n /\n\n    \n/switches\n\n\n    \n!\u2014Listeners --\n\n    \nsharedListeners\n\n      \nadd name=\ncitrixTraceListener\n type=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Diagnostics.CircularTraceListener,Citrix.DeliveryServices.Diagnostics, Version=2.6.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=e8b77d454fa2a856\n \n           initializeData=\nC:\\Program Files\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Admin\\trace\\Authentication.svclog\n\n           maxFileSizeKB=\n5000\n /\n\n    \n/sharedListeners\n\n    \ntrace autoflush=\nfalse\n /\n\n  \n/system.diagnostics\n \n\n\n\n\nTo configure tracing, use the Set-DSTraceLevel PowerShell command. For example, to enable verbose tracing for all components use the following: \n\n\n# Load the StoreFront snap-ins and modules\n\n \n$Env:PROGRAMFILES\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Scripts\\ImportModules.ps1\n\n# Set the trace level to be verbose for all components\nSet-DSTraceLevel -All -TraceLevel Verbose\nHelp for the Set-DSTraceLevel command can be obtained by using the standard Get-Help command,  for example: \nGet-Help Set-DSTraceLevel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nTracing information is written to a circular trace log at:\n\n\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Admin\\trace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoreFront automatically captures Error trace messages. Due to the large amount of data that can potentially be generated, tracing may significantly impact the performance of StoreFront, so it is recommended that the Info or Verbose levels are not used unless specifically required for troubleshooting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following illustrates how to programmatically access an event source named MyTraceSource:\n\n\npublic static class MyTraceSourceHelper \n{\n    static MyTraceSourceHelper()\n    {\n        Tracer = TracerManager.GetTracer(\nMyTraceSource\n);\n    }\n\n    public static Tracer Tracer { get; private set; }\n}\nThis is used as follows:\nMyTraceSourceHelper.Tracer.WriteError(\nAn error occurred.\n);\nA trace source must be defined in the containing application configuration as illustrated below:\n\nconfiguration\n  \n  \nsystem.diagnostics\n\n    \nsources\n\n      \nsource name=\nMyTraceSource\n\n        \nlisteners\n\n          \nadd name=\ncitrixTraceListener\n /\n\n        \n/listeners\n\n      \n/source\n\n    \n/sources\n\n    \nswitches\n\n      \nadd name=\nMyTraceSource\n value=\nError\n /\n\n    \n/switches\n\n    \nsharedListeners\n\n      \nadd name=\ncitrixTraceListener\n    \n           type=\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Diagnostics.CircularTraceListener,\n                 Citrix.DeliveryServices.Diagnostics, Version=2.6.0.0, Culture=neutral,\n                 PublicKeyToken=e8b77d454fa2a856\n\ninitializeData=\nC:\\Program Files\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Admin\\trace\\Store.svclog\n              \n           maxFileSizeKB=\n5000\n /\n\n    \n/sharedListeners\n\n    \ntrace autoflush=\nfalse\n /\n\n  \n/system.diagnostics\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\nWhere appropriate, it is possible to use the built-in StoreFront trace sources. The following illustrates how to write to the Forms Protocol trace source:\n\n\nusing Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.FormsProtocol.Diagnostics;\nTraceHelper.Tracer.WriteError(\nAn error occurred.\n);\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2   WRITING TO THE EVENT LOG\n\n\nStoreFront contains a static helper class for writing to the event log at:\nEvent viewer \n Applications and Services Logs \n Citrix Delivery Services\nThe interface for Citrix.DeliveryServices.Logging.Common.Logger is detailed at:\nAuthSDK.zip/Assemblies/StoreFront/Citrix.DeliveryServices.Logging.Interfaces.XML\n\n\nAn event log entry requires:\n\n\n\n\nMessage type, which is one of: Success, Information, Warning or Error\n\n\nA source that defines the component where the message originated\n\n\nAn event identifier that uniquely identifies the event\n\n\nA task category\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n            Logger.LogMessage(\n                1,\n                30000,\n                MessageType.ERROR,\n                null,\n                Resources.AuthenticateUnexpectedErrorText\n                );\n\n\n\n\nFor StoreFront, custom implementations should use a Task Category value between 30000 and 31000.\n\n\n4  StoreFront Services Feature Packaging and Deployment\n\n\nThe StoreFront Authentication Service and Administration Console have extension points for adding new authentication protocols to the solution without modifying either container. There is a pattern for creating a new authentication protocol that results in a StoreFront Feature Package, described here, that can be deployed using existing StoreFront deployment mechanisms. All the existing authentication methods utilize these extension points, and the samples document demonstrate how third parties can take advantage of these mechanisms.\n\n\n4.1  StoreFront Package\n\n\nA StoreFront Package is a compressed archive of the files required for the feature, along with meta-data to describe how the files should be added to the system.\n\n\nThe Packages should be placed in the directory: FeaturePackages at the path specified by the InstallDir value of the key:\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServicesManagement\n\n\nWhen a package is deployed, the files are extracted to a directory with the same name as the package in the directory: Features at the path specified by the InstallDir value of the key:\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Citrix\\DeliveryServicesManagement\n\n\nWhen the package has been expanded by the StoreFront Framework, it should contain the following directories:\n- _rels and package are used by the packaging mechanism and will not be described here\n- admin: This directory contains the files required for administration of the feature, including: PowerShell assemblies, the files used to merge the feature into an existing web application or service, and the files used to transform the configuration during upgrade.\n- GAC: This directory contains the assemblies that will have been added to the .Net Global Assembly Cache.\n- template: This directory contains the files that will be used to create an instance of the feature. For a web application feature, it will contain the files that will be added to the App_Data and bin directories. For a Windows Service it will contain all the files required for that service.\nAn msbuild task is provided to create a package from a package definition file and its usage is described in Section 5.4.9.\n\n\n4.2  Package Definition Language\n\n\nA StoreFront Feature Package is defined by an XML document that contains the following sections relevant to this discussion:\n- PackageFileName defines the name of the package file to be created\n- MetadataProperties contain information about the package that can be used to deploy the package\n- Files describe the files that are to be deployed to the system\n\n\nMetadata Properties\n\n\n\n\n allows a description name to be given to the feature.\n\n\n is the feature identifier and must be changed with a new Guid for any new Authentication method. Any Guid specified here also has to match the Feature Identifier specified in the: Feature Installer (if required), the custom actions, and Console extension.\n\n\n specifies the features parent, and should be unchanged from the samples, that is, the parent should be AuthenticationCore.\n\n\n list the other features that the feature depends on. For custom forms methods this should be unchanged from the forms samples, that is, the dependencies should include FormsProtocol and ExplicitCommon if Active Directory credential validation is required.\n\n\n describe any local groups used by this feature. In general, this will be empty for custom Forms.\n\n\n, \n \n \n are deprecated and should be empty.\n\n\n describes how many times a feature can be added to its parent, for custom forms and new authentication methods this should be 1.\n\n\n describes the class type to be used to create a feature instance.\n\n\n is the path to the assembly containing the Feature instance factory. If the factory is in the Global Assembly Cache, then this can be empty.\n\n\n and \n are deprecated, and should not be used.\n\n\n are name-value pairs of properties. For Authentication methods, there are certain mandatory properties, that must have the export attribute set to be true:\n\n\nauthProtocol must be \u201ctrue\u201d.\n\n\nauthProtocolDisplayNameKey defines the resource key for the authentication method display name in the StoreFront Administration Console. By convention this value is usually \u201cDisplayName\u201d.\n\n\nauthProtocolLocalizer defines the object that implements the interface: Citrix.DeliveryServices.Admin.Authentication.Extensions.Interfaces.IAuthenticationLocalizer: see Section 3.5.\n\n\nauthProtocolDisplayIndex defines the display order of authentication methods in the Add/Remove Authentication Methods in the StoreFront Administration Console. A good value for this is \u201c5000\u201d.\n\n\nauthProtocolDeployDefault defines whether the authentication method should be deployed by default when the authentication service is created, and should be \u201cfalse\u201d.\n\n\nprotocolChoice defines the protocol name in the choices and must be \u201cCustomForms\u201d for forms customizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles\n\n\nThe files deployed to the system are one of two categories: runtime files or administration files.\n- Runtime files are placed in a template directory when the package is expanded (installed), and then copied to the Authentication Service when the feature is deployed.\n- Administration files are used in the administration of the feature and include the following categories:\n    - Files that are to be placed in the Global Assembly Cache, such as Configuration Sections\n    - PowerShell snap-ins\n    - Performance counters\n\n\nThe \n element contains other elements:\n- \n defines where the feature packager should get the file from.\n- \n is where the file should be placed when deployed. The location is relative to the expanded feature directory.\n- \n relate to IIS Authentication options and should be empty for custom forms.\n- \n specifies whether the file should be packaged for Debug and Release versions.\n\n\nThe \n element also has attributes:\n- addToGac. If \u201ctrue\u201d the file is added to the GAC.\n- installUtil. If \u201ctrue\u201d the InstallUtil program (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/50614e95(v=vs.90).aspx ) is run on the specified file. This is used for features such as performance counters and PowerShell snap-ins, where the assembly has to be registered with the system.\n- Register. If true then the regsvr32 program (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490985.aspx ) is run on the specified file. As an example, this can be used to register COM objects with the system.\n- includeInManifest. If \u201ctrue\u201d, then include in the package manifest. This is used for files that will be part of the template.\n- replicate. If \u201ctrue\u201d this file will be copied to all members of a StoreFront cluster as part of a propagation action.\n\n\n5  Code Samples\n\n\n5.1  Introduction\n\n\nThe Authentication SDK contains two form customization samples: Test Forms and Magic Word Authentication. In addition, the Certificate Identity Declaration sample demonstrates how to add a completely new authentication method, although this also requires adding a customization to the Citrix Receivers. The SDK also contains pre-built installers for all the samples.\nBefore attempting to deploy the pre-built sample installers, you must add the following certificate to the Third-Party Root Certification Authorities store of the Local Computer account where StoreFront is installed: AuthSDK.zip/Certificates/YourCompany.cer\nThis is mandatory for each server in a StoreFront Server Group. This is not mandatory for the development machine.\nThe installers deploy StoreFront Feature packages and add-ins to the StoreFront Administration Console. To actually deploy and enable a sample, use the Add/Remove Methods action from the Authentication node of the Administration Console.\nBefore attempting to uninstall a sample, you must remove the associated authentication method using the Add/Remove Methods action. The sample can then be removed using the standard Add/Remove Programs control panel applet.\n\n\n5.2  Getting Started\n\n\nIn order to open and build the samples, you must first provision a development environment. This requires the following components to be installed on a suitable Windows machine, as described in the prerequisites (see Section 1.2.1).\nAll the other tools and components required to build the samples are included in the SDK.\nA temporary code-signing certificate for test purposes has been provided in the following location:\nAuthSDK.zip/Certificates/YourCompany.pfx\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe private key is not password protected.\n\n\n\n\nThe following certificate is the accompanying public certificate that can be added to the Trusted Root certificates for testing:\nAuthSDK.zip/Certificates/YourCompany.cer\nBefore releasing your integration, you should purchase a code-signing certificate, backed by a public certificate authority.\nOnce the above steps have been completed, you can open the sample Visual Studio solution file (*.sln) and successfully build the samples.\n\n\n5.3  Code Security\n\n\nBest practice is to use a code-signing certificate (that is, a certificate marked with the Extended Key Usage object id: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3) to digitally sign executing code to provide assurance as to the source of the code. For more information see [7]. The StoreFront Administration Console expects all PowerShell Scripts and extension assemblies to have Authenticode signatures.\n\n\nWhilst best practice is to use a code-signing certificate issued by a public certificate authority, the samples use a self-signed certificate for this purpose, which leads to the following:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using the pre-built sample installers, then it is required to add the certificate at AuthSDK.zip/Certificates/YourCompany.cer to the Third-Party Root Certification Authorities store of the Computer, before installing the sample msi.\n\n\nNote that the samples have not been time stamped, see [8].\n\n\nWhen creating a real authentication method, the post build tasks should include the signing task as demonstrated in the samples, but using a code-signing certificate for your company, and the files should be time stamped.\n\n\n\n\n5.4  Visual Studio Solution Layout\n\n\nThe StoreFront assemblies referenced by the samples, along with other third-party assemblies, are in the Assemblies directory. The Assemblies directory also contains the StoreFront XML documentation files. The tools used to build and unit test the solutions are in the Tools directory. The documentation, including the third party notices, is in the Documentation directory.\nIn order to add assemblies to the Global Assembly Cache, the assemblies must be strongly named. The Authentication SDK provides a strong-name key pair, but it is recommended that developers create a new strong-name key pair for their customization.\nThe samples follow the same basic layout and can be composed of the following projects:\n\n\n5.4.1   CONFIGURATION\n\n\nIf the authentication customization requires configuration, then a C# class library project should be added.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe Microsoft Management Console for Windows Server 2008 R2 only supports the .NET 2.0 runtime, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg983006(v=vs.85).aspx. As a result, all assemblies that are loaded by the MMC must target the .NET 3.5 run time in Visual Studio. This includes configuration assemblies as they are loaded by reflection from the StoreFront Configuration Provider in the PowerShell modules. Assemblies that target .NET 3.5 SP1 can be loaded into the .NET 4 runtime, so these assemblies can still be loaded in the StoreFront Management Console running on Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 operating systems.\n\n\nIn order for the StoreFront Configuration Provider to be able to load the configuration sections, the associated assembly must be stored in the Global Assembly Cache. Hence the configuration assembly must be strongly named.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, this project shouldcontain the following:\n- Configuration Section and Elements: These define standard .NET configuration elements.\n- Settings: This is a data object that contains the configuration.\n- Configuration Parser: This object uses the configuration section to create the Settings object.\n\n\n5.4.2   CONSOLE.EXTENSION\n\n\nThis C# class library project should always be present, because it contains the Authentication Management Extension for this customization that is used by the StoreFront Administration Console for adding and removing the customization.\nThis will contain:\n= A Localizer that provides the localized strings for the StoreFront Administration Console.\n- The implementation of IAuthenticationExtension to provide any required status messages\n\n\nIf the customization has a configuration that is managed by the StoreFront Administration Console, then this project will also contain the view extension that may contain:\n- Dialogs\n- Data Models and Business Logic\n= Powershell commands\n\n\n5.4.3   FEATURE\n\n\nThis C# class library project contains the code to be added to the Authentication web application to perform the customized authentication.\nIf the customization is a forms customization it may contain the following:\n- Templates: The forms templates used by the customization\n- Forms: The associated forms objects\n- Conversation: Controls the flow of forms that make up the authentication conversation\n- Diagnostics: Any tracing or event log messages\n- StartupModule: This is a start-up module that is used to populate the Service locator with objects required by the system. This may include a settings object defined in the configuration project.\n\n\nIf the customization is a new authentication protocol, then it may contain the following:\n- Controllers: ASP.NET MVC controller that manages the authentication protocol\n- Diagnostics: Any tracing or event log messages\n\n\n5.4.4   FEATUREINSTALLER\n\n\nThis is an optional C# class library project that is required if:\n- The customization requires specialized behavior to be run during deployment of the feature\n- The customization requires specialized PowerShell commands\n\n\nAdditional Deployment Steps\n\n\nThe StoreFront features are deployed as a series of steps which are orchestrated by a deployer. A base class is provided, Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Framework.Admin.ProtocolFeatureInstanceBase, which performs the steps required for the deployment of a standard authentication feature.\nIf additional steps are required, then a sub-class can be created to add additional steps. The full list of built-in deployment steps can be found at:\nAuthSDK.zip/Assemblies/StoreFront/Citrix.DeliveryServices.Framework.Deployment.Steps.XML\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe feature instance class used for deployment is controlled by the InstanceFactoryType element in the feature package definition file; see Section 4.\n\n\n\n\nPowerShell Commands\n\n\nIt is not expected that many PowerShell commands will be required by customizations. However, the samples illustrate how commands can be written.\nA base class is provided from which all PowerShell commands should be derived. This provides a tracing and auditing facility by creating output in the following directory every time that the command is run:\n%PROGRAMFILES%\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Admin\\logs\nThe commands are contained within a PowerShell snap-in. The Microsoft documentation for creating a snap-in can be found here:\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714450(v=vs.85).aspx.\nThe PowerShell snap-in is registered with the system when the associated Feature class is installed. This is controlled by setting the installUtil attribute to be true on the associated assembly in the Feature package definition file, see Section 4.2, for more details.\n\n\n5.4.5   FEATURETEMPLATE\n\n\nThis directory may contain the following:\n- web.merge.config or web.merge.xslt: This file describes the configuration entries that are merged into the Authentication Service web application\u2019s web.config file during deployment of the customization.\n- web.unmerge.config or web.unmerge.xslt: This file describes the configuration entries that are removed from the Authentication Service web application\u2019s web.config file during the removal of the customization.\n- App_Data/resources/*.resx: These are the end-user facing strings that are used by the customization.\n\n\n5.4.6   INSTALLER\n\n\nThis Wix installer project is used to deploy the customization.\n\n\nThe installer has the following responsibilities during deployment:\n- Run the VerifyProtocolNotInstalled and WarnIfAdminConsoleOpen custom actions described  in Section 5.4.7\n- Copy the Feature package to the StoreFront FeaturePackages directory\n- Deploy the Administration Console Extension assemblies to the management InstallDir and to configure the registry, as described in Section 3.1, so that they are loaded by the console when it starts\n\n\nThe installer has the following responsibilities during uninstall:\n- Run the RemoveInstalledClass custom action, described  in Section 5.4.7\n- Remove the Feature package and registry entries added during install\n\n\nThis project also contains the Feature Package definition, as described in Section 4.1, and runs the FeaturePackager msbuild task in the post-build step to build the Feature Package.\n\n\n5.4.7   INSTALLER.CUSTOMACTIONS\n\n\nThis C# class library project contains the custom actions required by the installer in section 5.4.6.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe custom actions must be targeted at the x64 Platform and not AnyCPU. This is to force the Windows Installer to run the actions as x64, which is required to gain access to the correct registry entries.\n\n\n\n\nIn general there are three custom actions:\n- RemoveInstalledClass: This removes the installed Feature class. If there are any existing instances of the Feature, the action will display an error message that tells  the administrator what to do. The uninstall will then exit without uninstalling the customization.\n- WarnIfAdminConsoleOpen: This checks whether the StoreFront Administration Console is open. If it is open, the action displays a warning message tellinging the administrator to close and re-open the console before deploying the customization.\n- VerifyProtocolNotInstalled: This verifies whether there is another feature that implements the target authentication method. If there is an existing method, the action displays an error message and exits without installing the customization.\n\n\nIn general, the code can be copied from an existing sample, and only the Feature identifier and Authentication Protocol Name  need to be changed.\n\n\n5.4.8   UNITTESTS\n\n\nThis C# class library project contains unit tests for the customizations. This may contain tests for the following:\n- Merge Tests: Verify the merge and unmerge of entries into the Authentication Service web application\u2019s web.config.\n- Route Tests: Verify that the MVC routes have been configured correctly.\n- Service Locator Tests: Verify that required objects have been added to the IoC container.\n- Authentication Tests: Verify the custom authentication.\n\n\n5.4.9   BUILD TASKS\n\n\nPackageFeature\nThis task is used to generate the feature package from the feature package definition file (see Section 4), and is usually part of the Installer project.\n\n\nThe task has the following properties:\n- PackageDefinitionFile: The path of the package definition file to process.\n- Configuration: The configuration to build, one of: Debug or Release.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nConfiguration Condition=\n '$(Configuration)' == '' \nDebug\n/Configuration\n\n\nPackageFeature PackageDefinitionFile=\nPackage\\Feature.pkg\n Configuration=\n$(Configuration)\n /\n\n\n\n\nMsiLocaliser\n\n\nThis task is used to generate a multilingual installer and is usually part of the installer project.\n\n\nThe task has the following properties:\n- Cultures: A \u2018;\u2019 separated list of language codes.\n- TargetName: The file name of the created multi-lingual installer.\n= TargetFolder: This folder should contain all the folders corresponding to the individual localized installers.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n \nConfiguration Condition=\n '$(Configuration)' == '' \nDebug\n/Configuration\n\n\nCultures Condition=\n '$(Cultures)' == '' \nen-US;de-DE;es-ES;fr-FR;ja-JP;zh-CN\n/Cultures\n\n\nMsiLocaliser Cultures=\n$(Cultures)\n TargetFolder=\nbin\\x64\\$(Configuration)\n \n                          TargetName=\nInstaller-x64.msi\n /",

New authentication methods are added by adding new ASP.NET Routes into the web application and mapping them to new Controllers. For forms based authentication, the forms are rendered using a custom mechanism based on ASP.Net Razor templates [9].\nConfiguration data is stored in the associated web.config file. When the web application starts, a configured set of start-up modules are run, which parse the configuration into settings objects that are stored in a Service Locator [6], along with other long-lived objects.   The StoreFront Administration Console utilizes a PowerShell layer to configure the solution. The PowerShell layer makes extensive use of a custom configuration provider that allows certain portions of the web.config file to be accessed as if it were a mounted drive; see Section 3.4.3.

            "text": "The actual getting and setting of configuration properties is achieved using the StoreFront Configuration Provider. The provider exposes parts of configuration files as hierarchical namespaces, in the same way that file systems are hierarchical namespaces, comprised of directories that contain files and other directories. This is available for all web.config and service.config files.\nIn general examples of how to modify the configuration settings can be found in the StoreFront PowerShell modules described in Section 3.4.2 Alternatively a namespace can be opened and browsed, as described below, to find appropriate settings.  The five steps in using the StoreFront Configuration Provider are:  1 Open a web application configuration file  The following illustrates how to open a drive for the authentication service in the default tenant:  # Load the StoreFront snap-ins and modules   $Env:PROGRAMFILES\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Scripts\\ImportModules.ps1 \n# Get the authentication service web app for the default tenant\n$authWebApp = Get-DSAuthenticationServiceWebApp\n# Get the configuration for the web app\n$appPath = GetAppPathWeb -SiteId $authWebApp.SiteId `\n                         \u2013VirtualPath $authWebApp.VirtualPath -Name  DSAuth \n$appConfig = Get-Item $appPath\ncd $appPath  2 Open a Windows service configuration file  Configuring Windows services is unlikely to be necessary. However, if required, then the site name is needed to identify the service to be configured. The following site names are valid for the specified Windows service name:\n- Citrix Credential Wallet: CredentialWallet\n- Citrix Subscriptions Store: SubscriptionsStoreService\n- Citrix Default Domain Services: DefaultDomainService\n- Citrix Peer Resolution Service: PNRS\n- Citrix StoreFront Protocol Transition: ProtocolTransitionService  The following illustrates how to open a drive for the Credential Wallet.  # Load the StoreFront snap-ins and modules   $Env:PROGRAMFILES\\Citrix\\Receiver StoreFront\\Scripts\\ImportModules.ps1 \n$driveName =  CW \n$siteName =  CredentialWallet \n$cwDrive = GetAppPath -AppPath $siteName -Name $driveName\n$cwAppConfig = Get-Item $cwDrive\ncd $cwDrive  3 Access data  The majority of the settings are in the /DeliveryServices namespace, which can be navigated and explored using the standard dir, or ls alias. For example, the following enumerates all the namespaces in a default authentication service:  PS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices  ls | select { $_.PSPath }\n $_.PSPath\n-----------\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\citrixFederationAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\formsProtocol\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\authentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\routing\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\delegatedKerberosAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\defaultRoutes\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\delegatedExplicitAuthentication\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\commonExplicitEndpoints\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\certificateManager\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\authenticationService\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\cryptography\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\tokenManager\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\windowsEventLogger\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\logger\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\credentialWalletClient\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\delegatedDirectoryClaimFactory\nDeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\localisation  The standard Get-Item and Get-ItemProperty commands can be used to access the properties. For example, the following illustrates displaying the explicit business logic settings:  PS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices  Get-ItemProperty DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\nPSPath                      : DeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\nPSParentPath                : DeliveryServices::DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\nPSChildName                 : explicitBL\nPSDrive                     : DSAuth\nPSProvider                  : DeliveryServices\nAuthenticatorName           : defaultDelegatedAuthenticator\nRequireAccountSIDs          : True\nHideDomainField             : True\nAllowUserPasswordChange     : Never\nShowPasswordExpiryWarning   : Windows\nPasswordExpiryWarningPeriod : 10\nAllowZeroLengthPassword     : False  The following illustrates how to set a variable to determine whether or not the domain field is displayed in the explicit logon form:  PS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices  $showDomainField = -not` \n                          (Get-Item DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices\\explicitBL\\HideDomainField)\nPS DSAuth:\\DeliveryServices  $showDomainField\nFalse  4 Set data  The configuration settings can be modified using the standard Set-Item and Set-ItemProperty commands. However, StoreFront also has a command to set multiple properties simultaneously. For example, the following sets the password expiry warning notice to be five days irrespective of any Windows policy:  SetItemProperties `\n   -Path ${appPath}DeliveryServices\\explicitBL `\n   -Values @{  ShowPasswordExpiryWarning  =  Custom ; `\n               PasswordExpiryWarningPeriod  = 5 }  5 Save and close a configuration file  The setting of properties above does not commit the changes to the configuration file. The following demonstrates how to save the modified configuration, and to close the associated namespace.  # Save the modified configuration\n$appConfig.Save()\n# Close the associated namespace\nRemoveDeliveryServicesDrive -Name  DSAuth   Note   It is important to close the associated namespace when managing the associated configuration is complete.  For web applications, saving the configuration will result in the configuration being automatically reloaded. However, for Windows services, the associated service must be manually restarted, using the Restart-DSService command.",

            "text": "Citrix Common Forms Authentication API\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nScope\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the StoreFront Common Forms Authentication Application Programming Interface.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nCitrix has devised a common authentication protocol that is implemented by its next generation services and gateway platforms, referred to here as StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway. Citrix is implementing client support, in Receiver and Worx, for this common authentication protocol in native user agents for the major device platforms, notably Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and in Receiver for Web for browser user agents. See StoreFront Token Services v2.0 [1] for more details.\n\n\nAn important part of the common authentication protocol is a generic forms language, designed to allow third parties to express a wide range of authentication forms using a set of user interface constructs that are similar to basic HTML forms; see RFC 1867 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt] and 2388 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388.txt] for more details.\n\n\nThird parties are able to extend the authentication methods supported by StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway by implementing server logic that emits and consumes the Common Forms language; see StoreFront Services Authentication SDK v2.6 [2] for more details.\n\n\nThe Common Forms protocol represents a secure conversation between the server and the user agent on the client, where forms are generated by the server, rendered by the useragent, completed by the user, and returned to the server by the user agent. Whilst the forms generated may be the same, the start and end of the conversations differ between StoreFront Service and NetScaler Gateway, representing their different needs. \n\n\nThe form generation and handling can be delegated from NetScaler Gateway to a StoreFront server by means of the Delegated Forms Authentication Protocol [3]. This allows a third party to create one customization that can be used in both StoreFront and NetScaler Gateway.\n\n\nThis document details the StoreFront Services v2.6 conversation, specifying the messages at the HTTP level.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.StoreFront Token Services v2.0\n\n\n2.StoreFront Services Authentication SDK v2.6\n\n\n3.Delegated Forms Authentication Protocol\n\n\n4.Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language v2.6\n\n\nStoreFront Conversation\n\n\nFor maximum interoperability, the protocol is a REST API, that is, XML forms transmitted over HTTPS. The flow of forms and responses constitutes a conversation that can have state associated with the overall conversation through the use of HTTP sessions.\n\n\nThe convesations require HTTP state management, as described by RFC 2109 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt], in particular correct handling of cookies.\n\n\nNote: In the following sections, the definition of HTTP headers uses the notation defined in RFC 2616 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616].\n\n\nNote to client implementors: Implementors of long-lived clients should ensure that the session cookie is cleared at the end of the conversation.\n\n\nThe conversation contains sensitive information, such as passwords, so confidentiality and integrity are required. The expectation is that SS/TLS will be used between the client and the server to both maintain confidentiality and also for server identification, to ensure that the user agent sends confidential information only to trusted servers.\n\n\nFor StoreFront, the conversation starts with a Request Security Token (RST) message [1] to an endpoint obtained from the client as part of the Protocol Choices message [1]. A successful conversation ends with a Request Security Token Response (RSTR) message [1]. The conversation can also end with a failure form, an HTTP status code other than 200, or a network failure.\n\n\nFor the rest of the conversation the server returns authentication forms described in Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language v2.0 [4].\n\n\nNote to client implementors: Because a client does not know when a conversation will end, it should always set the HTTP Accept header to include both the Form and RSTR types.\n\n\nConversation Start\n\n\n\n\nURL: Usually obtained from the Protocol Choices data\n\n\nHTTP Method: POST\n\n\nAuthentication: None\n\n\nRequest Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\n\n\nAccept:\n\n\napplication/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml, \n\n\napplication/vnd.citrix.authenticateresponse-1+xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the conversation persists over several HTTP requests, the initial conversation start may include a Set-Cookie header. The usual HTTP semantics apply to this cookie, as described above. In addition, various aspects of the conversation are negotiated at the start of the conversation through the use of HTTP headers, as discussed below:\n\n\nCredential Type Negotiation\n\n\nThe Common Forms Language [4] contains a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration for the credential types, which means that new credential types can be added without breaking the schema. The behavior of user agents is to reject forms with unknown credential types. Hence credential types need to be negotiated between the client and server using the following HTTP header:\n\n\ncredential-Types-Header = \nX-Citrix-AM-CredentialTypes\n \n:\n field-value\nfield-value = *LWS credential-types-value *LWS\ncredential-types-value = 1#( credential-type-value )\ncredential-type-value = *TEXT\n\n\n\n\nThe credential types header is a comma-separated list of credential types that the client supports.\n\n\nExample: \n       X-Citrix-AM-CredentialTypes: none, username, domain, password, newpassword,\n                                passcode, savecredentials, textcredential\n\n\n\n\nNew clients will use the above HTTP header to signal the credential types that are known in a comma-separated list. Older clients do not set this header, so if the header is missing then the following credential types will be assumed: none, username, domain, password, newpassword, passcode, savecredentials, textcredential.\nIf a client does not support a required credential type, then the behavior is defined by the form implementation on the server, which may choose to terminate the conversation, or supply a simplified form that the client can process.\n\n\nLabel Type Negotiation\n\n\nThe Common Forms Language [4] contains a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration for the label types, which means that new label types can be added without breaking the schema. Label types can be negotiated between the client and server using the following HTTP header:\n\n\nlabel-Types-Header = \nX-Citrix-AM-LabelTypes\n \n:\n field-value\nfield-value = *LWS label-types-value *LWS\nlabel-types-value = 1#( label-type )\nlabel-type = *TEXT\n\n\n\n\nThe label types header is a comma-separated list of label values that the client supports.\n\n\nExample: \n\n\n       X-Citrix-AM-LabelTypes: none, plain, heading, information, warning,\n                           error, confirmation\n\n\n\n\nNew clients will use the above HTTP header to signal the label types that are known in a comma-separated list. Older clients do not set this header, so if the header is missing then the following label types shall be assumed: none, plain, heading, information, warning, error, confirmation.\nIf a client does not support a required label type, then the behavior is defined by the form implementation on the server, which may choose to terminate the conversation, or supply a simplified form that the client can process.\nNotes regarding images:\n\n\n\n\nThe default list of label types does not contain image. This is because none of the known legacy clients supported rendering images.\n\n\nImages are intended for authentication purposes, such as captcha images, and are not intended for generic branding.\n\n\nThe image data supplied in the form is to be interpreted as a Data URI as defined by RFC 2397, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397]\n\n\n\n\nLanguage Negotiation\n\n\nThe textual data displayed in the form is defined by the StoreFront Server. In order to supply text in the appropriate language for the user, the server supports the standard HTTP language negotiation mechanism through the use of the Accept-Language header as described in RFC 2616 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616].\n\n\nAccept-Language-Header = \nAccept-Language\n \n:\n field-value\nfield-value = *LWS accept-language-value *LWS\naccept-language-value = 1#( language-range [ \n;\n \nq\n \n=\n qvalue ] )\nlanguage-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( \n-\n 1*8ALPHA ) ) | \n*\n )\n\n\n\n\nThe header value may include a comma-separated list of language ranges. Each language range may be given an associated quality value that represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages specified by that range.

Given a value to store, the client adds the same header to all further requests in the current and subsequent Common Forms authentication conversations with that authentication service.\n\n\nHeader syntax and semantics\n\n\nThe same header, defined below, is used in both HTTP requests and responses.\n\n\nStorage-Header = \nX-Citrix-AM-Storage\n \n:\n field-value\nfield-value = *LWS storage-value *LWS\nstorage-value = *TEXT\n\n\n\n\nThe header value may include leading and trailing whitespace, which should be ignored, and the storage value is a plain text string. The storage value may be omitted entirely, leaving a header with an empty value.\n\n\nEach X-Citrix-AM-Storage header represents a value stored by the user agent on behalf of the specific authentication service. Each authentication service may store only one value, but a client that interacts with multiple authentication services must be able store one value for each service. An authentication service is identified by the start URL of a forms conversation, including scheme, hostname, port number and path, but excluding query strings and fragments. The URLs of subsequent requests in a forms auth conversation are likely to differ from the start URL so clients must be careful not to simply use the current request URL in making decisions about storage.\n\n\nClients must compare URLs in accordance with the URI comparison rules defined in RFC 2616 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616]. \n\n\nNote: a client may authenticate against a third party authentication service through Delegated Forms Authentication using different start URLs, for example one URL for NetScaler Gateway and one URL for StoreFront. In this case the third authentication service will end up setting two storage values on the client. This is conceptually not ideal but it should be sufficient because the main goal is parity with HTTP cookie-based authentication methods.\n\n\nThe X-Citrix-AM-Storage header is only valid during a forms-based authentication conversation. Clients should not update storage or send a storage value outside the authentication conversation. Clients should update the storage value if the header is received on any valid forms response during the conversation, including: failure forms (for example a \u2018fail\u2019 or \u2018cancel\u2019 result, or failure status) and Request Token Responses.\nThere is no mechanism for a client to advertise that it supports persistent storage, other than by returning a previously stored value.\n\n\nNotes to server implementors:\n- It is the server implementor\u2019s responsibility to appropriately protect the data stored on the client, for example using HMACs if data origin and integrity are important, or encryption if privacy is also required.\n- The maximum size of the storage header on an HTTP response is 5016 bytes, including the header name and whitespace around the value.\n\n\nNote to client implementors: Clients should treat a storage value as an opaque string and should not attempt to interpret the value. The content of a storage value is meaningful only to the originating server.\n\n\nServer-to-Client HTTP Responses\n\n\nAn X-Citrix-AM-Storage header on a response is a directive for the client to persistently and securely store the value on behalf of the sending authentication service. Clients should store the received value immediately and not wait until the end of the authentication conversation, such that if an authentication attempt is abandoned the client will be able to send the last seen value on starting the next authentication attempt.\n\n\nIf the X-Citrix-AM-Storage response header has an empty value, then clients should delete the storage value for the sending authentication service; subsequently clients do not need to send the empty X-Citrix-AM-Storage header.\n\n\nIf a forms response does not include an X-Citrix-AM-Storage header, clients must assume that there is no change required, and must keep the current storage value unchanged, and continue to send the last seen value.\n\n\nIf the response is not a valid forms response or is otherwise not understood by the client, the client must ignore any X-Citrix-AM-Storage header and not update the storage value.\n\n\nServers should not include more than one X-Citrix-AM-Storage header in the same response. If multiple storage headers are received, clients should process the first one only.\n\n\nStorage values do not have an explicit or implicit expiry date and potentially may be retained indefinitely. However, clients should delete all stored values if the user uninstalls or otherwise resets the client software, for example using the \u201cReset\u201d feature in Receiver.\n\n\nClient-to-Server HTTP Requests\n\n\nIf an authentication service has previously set a storage value on the client, the client must send the value to the authentication service using the X-Citrix-AM-Storage header on every request during a forms authentication attempt, starting with the request for the initial form.\n\n\nClients may omit the header if they have no value stored for the authentication service.\n\n\nWire Example\n\n\nMessage\nCommentary\nClient internal storage table\nOrigin service start URL\nStorage value\nnone>\nA first time use scenario, so there are, no stored values.\nRequest\nPOST https://example.com/Citrix/Authentication/CustomForms/Authenticate HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml,application/vnd.citrix.authenticateresponse-1+xml,text/xml\nContent-Length: xxx\n?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\nrequesttoken xmlns=\"http://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttoken\">\nfor-service>32a290eb-7521-cd92-1394-475927c3a239\n/for-service>\nfor-service-url>https:// example.com /Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n/for-service-url>\nreqtokentemplate>\n/reqtokentemplate>\nrequested-lifetime>0.08:00:00\n/requested-lifetime>\n/requesttoken>\nThere\u2019s no stored value, so no o X-Citrix-AM-Storage header needs to be sent.\nResponse\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.authenticateresponse-1+xml\nX-Citrix-AM-Storage: FTU\nContent-Length: xxx\n?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\nAuthenticateResponse xmlns=\"http://citrix.com/authentication/response/1\">\nStatus>success\n/Status>\nResult>more-info\n/Result>\nStateContext>f8d463c0\n/StateContext>\nAuthenticationRequirements>\nPostBack>Citrix/Authentication/CustomForms/SendForm\n/PostBack>\nCancelPostBack>Citrix/Authentication/CustomForms /CancelForm\n/CancelPostBack>\nCancelButtonText>Cancel\n/CancelButtonText>\nRequirements>\nRequirement>\nCredential>\nID>username\n/ID>\nType>username\n/Type>\n/Credential>\nLabel>\nText>User name:\n/Text>\nType>plain\n/Type>\n/Label>\nInput>\nText />\n/Input>\n/Requirement>\nRequirement>\nCredential>\nID>password\n/ID>\nType>password\n/Type>\n/Credential>\nLabel>\nText>Password:\n/Text>\nType>plain\n/Type>\n/Label>\nInput>\nText>\nSecret>true\n/Secret>\n/Text>\n/Input>\n/Requirement>\nRequirement>\nCredential>\nID>nextBtn\n/ID>\nType>none\n/Type>\n/Credential>\nLabel>\nType>none\n/Type>\n/Label>\nInput>\nButton>Sign On\n/Button>\n/Input>\n/Requirement>\n/Requirements>\n/AuthenticationRequirements>\n/AuthenticateResponse>\nThe authentication service sets\u00a0 a value for the first time.\nClient internal storage table\nOrigin service start URL\nStorage value\nhttps://example.com:443/Citrix/Authentication/CustomForms/Authenticate\nFTU\nThe client stores the value against the authentication service start URL\nPOST https://example.com/Citrix/Authentication/CustomForms/SendForm HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml,application/vnd.citrix.authenticateresponse-1+xml,text/xml\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: xxx\nX-Citrix-AM-Storage: FTU\nStateContext=f8d463c0\n=user\n=pass\n=Sign%20On\nThe client posts back credentials, also sending the latest storage value.

The POST should also set the appropriate cookie header.\n\n\nNote to client implementors: Elements that are marked as read-only should not be returned to the server\n\n\nButtons\n\n\nWhere there are multiple buttons defined, only the button selected by the user should be sent in the form response in the form: \ncontrolId=localized-button-text\n\n\nConsider a form containing two buttons:\n\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nID\nbackButtonId\n/ID\n\n          \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nButton\nBack\n/Button\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nID\nnextButtonId\n/ID\n\n          \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nButton\nNext\n/Button\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the Back button is selected, then the POST should contain the back button as follows:\n\n\nbackButtonId=Back\n\n\nHowever, if the Next button is selected, then the POST should contain the following:\n\nnextButtonId=Next\n\n\nText-Based Input\n\n\nFor text-based input, the text supplied by the user should be sent, appropriately encoded, in the form response in the form:  credentialID=user-supplied-text\n\n\nConsider the form containing the following text credential:\n\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nID\ntextId\n/ID\n\n          \nType\ntextcredential\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nText\nGeneric text\n/Text\n\n          \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nText\n\n            \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n          \n/Text\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nThe following demonstrates the form response that should be returned for various text inputs:\n\n\n\n\ndomain\\user: textId=domain%5cuser\n\n\n\u00e1\u00e2\u00e4\u00e7\u00e8\u00e9: textId=%c3%a1%c3%a2%c3%a4%c3%a7%c3%a8%c3%a9\n\n\n: textId=\n\n\n\n\nCheck box\n\n\nFor check boxes, the value returned by the client should be true if the check box is selected and false if not.\n\n\nNote for client implementors: The true and false values are case-sensitive.\n\n\nConsider the form containing the following check box:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\ncheckboxId\n/ID\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nDo you consent to this operation?\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nCheckBox\n\n      \nInitialValue\ntrue\n/InitialValue\n\n    \n/CheckBox\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the checkbox is selected, then the POST should contain the following:\n\n\ncheckboxId=true\n\n\nIf the check box is not selected, then the POST should contain the following:\n\n\ncheckboxId=false\n\n\nSave Credentials Control\n\n\nBecause this has important semantic obligations for the client, there is a distinguished credential type to specify when the client can offer the user the option to save credentials. This allows the server to control whether the option is presented, and to specify the appropriate localized description.\n\n\nNotes for client implementors:\n\n\n\n\nOnly credentials with a SaveID tag are permitted to be saved.\n\n\nClients that don\u2019t support saving credentials should omit the requirement element from display.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the form containing the following save credentials check box.\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\nsaveCredentials\n/ID\n\n    \nType\nsavecredentials\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nRemember my password\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nCheckBox\n\n      \nInitialValue\nfalse\n/InitialValue\n\n    \n/CheckBox\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the check box is selected, then the POST should contain the following, as for a normal check box defined above:\n\n\nsaveCredentials=true\n\n\nNotes for client implementors:\n\n\nClear Saved Credential\n\n\nIf during the authentication conversation the client receives a form with result code \u201cmore-info\u201d, which contains the SaveID of a credential that has already been submitted to the server, the client should infer that the credential was not valid. The client should immediately erase the saved credential set. Saved credentials should also be erased if a request to a StoreFront service URL results in a CitrixAuth challenge with reason: badpassword\n\n\nUpdate Saved Credential\n\n\nDuring an authentication conversation, the client may receive a form with result code \u201cupdate-credentials\u201d. This indicates that the user is updating a credential (for example changing a password). If the SaveID of the credential matches that of a saved credential, the new value of the credential should be saved if authentication succeeds.\n\n\nRadio Buttons\n\n\nFor radio buttons, individual items contain localized display text and a non-localized value. Radio buttons should return the value associated with the currently selected item.\n\n\nConsider the form containing the following radio buttons:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\nradioButtonId\n/ID\n\n    \nType\ntextcredential\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nChoose one\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nRadioButton\n\n      \nInitialSelection\nChoice1\n/InitialSelection\n\n      \nDisplayValues\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nChoice One Display Text\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nChoice1\n/Value\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nChoice Two Display Text\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nChoice2\n/Value\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nChoice Three Display Text\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nChoice3\n/Value\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n      \n/DisplayValues\n\n    \n/RadioButton\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the second item (Display Text Two) is selected, then the POST should contain the following:\n\n\nradioButtonId=Choice2\n\n\nNote for client implementors: The initial selection element is optional; the client implementor must decide what to do if there is no initial value.\n\n\nNote for server implementors: It is acceptable for clients to indicate that there is no selection by returning:\n\n\nradioButtonId=\n\n\nCombo Boxes\n\n\nA combo box allows a single item to be selected. For combo boxes, individual items contain localized display text and a non-localized value. Combo boxes should return the value associated with the currently selected item.\n\n\nConsider the form containing the following combo box:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\ncomboId\n/ID\n\n    \nType\ntextcredential\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nCombo-box\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nComboBox\n\n      \nInitialSelection\nValue2\n/InitialSelection\n\n      \nDisplayValues\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nDisplay Text One\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nValue1\n/Value\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nDisplay Text Two\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nValue2\n/Value\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nDisplay Text Three\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nValue3\n/Value\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n      \n/DisplayValues\n\n    \n/ComboBox\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the second item (Display Text Two) is selected, then the POST should contain the following:\n\n\ncomboId=Value2\n\n\nNote for client implementors:\n\n\n\n\nThe initial selection element is optional, and it is the client implementor\u2019s choice how this should be handled.\n\n\n\n\nNotes for server implementors:\n\n\n\n\nForm implementors should ensure that all display text items and values are unique and not empty.\n\n\nIt is acceptable for clients to indicate that there is no selection by returning: comboId=\n\n\nServers must be robust against invalid values being returned.\n\n\nIf the values are changed, it is suggested that any saved credential identifier is also changed to avoid the client sending back invalid saved credentials.\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Combo Boxes\n\n\nA multi-combo box allows multiple items to be selected. For multi-combo boxes, individual items contain localized display text, a non-localized value, and a flag indicating whether the item is selected. Multi-combo boxes should return an entry for each selected item of the form: itemID=value.\n\n\nConsider the form containing the following multi-combo box, where the second item is initially selected:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\nmultiComboId\n/ID\n\n    \nType\ntextcredential\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nMulti-select Combo\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nMultiComboBox\n\n      \nDisplayValues\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nAlice\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nValue1\n/Value\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nBob\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nValue2\n/Value\n\n          \nSelect\ntrue\n/Select\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n        \nDisplayValue\n\n          \nDisplay\nEve\n/Display\n\n          \nValue\nValue3\n/Value\n\n          \nSelect\nfalse\n/Select\n\n        \n/DisplayValue\n\n      \n/DisplayValues\n\n    \n/MultiComboBox\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the second item and third items (Bob and Eve) are selected, then the POST should contain the following:\n\n\nmultiComboId=Value2\nmultiComboId=Value3\n\n\nIf no items are selected, then the POST should contain the following:\n\n\nmultiComboId=\n\n\nNote for client implementors:\n- It is acceptable for clients to only return selected values that are unique.\n\n\nNotes for server implementors:\n- Form implementors should ensure that all display text items and values are unique\n- Servers must be robust against invalid values being returned.\n- If the values are changed, it is suggested that any saved credential identifier is also changed to avoid the client sending back invalid saved credentials.\n- Multi-combo boxes are not suitable for user name or domain credentials.\n\n\nX509 Certificates\n\n\nA multi-combo box allows multiple items to be selected.

            "text": "Citrix has devised a common authentication protocol that is implemented by its next generation services and gateway platforms, referred to here as StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway. Citrix is implementing client support, in Receiver and Worx, for this common authentication protocol in native user agents for the major device platforms, notably Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and in Receiver for Web for browser user agents. See StoreFront Token Services v2.0 [1] for more details.  An important part of the common authentication protocol is a generic forms language, designed to allow third parties to express a wide range of authentication forms using a set of user interface constructs that are similar to basic HTML forms; see RFC 1867 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt] and 2388 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388.txt] for more details.  Third parties are able to extend the authentication methods supported by StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway by implementing server logic that emits and consumes the Common Forms language; see StoreFront Services Authentication SDK v2.6 [2] for more details.  The Common Forms protocol represents a secure conversation between the server and the user agent on the client, where forms are generated by the server, rendered by the useragent, completed by the user, and returned to the server by the user agent. Whilst the forms generated may be the same, the start and end of the conversations differ between StoreFront Service and NetScaler Gateway, representing their different needs.   The form generation and handling can be delegated from NetScaler Gateway to a StoreFront server by means of the Delegated Forms Authentication Protocol [3]. This allows a third party to create one customization that can be used in both StoreFront and NetScaler Gateway.  This document details the StoreFront Services v2.6 conversation, specifying the messages at the HTTP level.",

            "text": "For maximum interoperability, the protocol is a REST API, that is, XML forms transmitted over HTTPS. The flow of forms and responses constitutes a conversation that can have state associated with the overall conversation through the use of HTTP sessions.  The convesations require HTTP state management, as described by RFC 2109 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt], in particular correct handling of cookies.  Note: In the following sections, the definition of HTTP headers uses the notation defined in RFC 2616 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616].  Note to client implementors: Implementors of long-lived clients should ensure that the session cookie is cleared at the end of the conversation.  The conversation contains sensitive information, such as passwords, so confidentiality and integrity are required. The expectation is that SS/TLS will be used between the client and the server to both maintain confidentiality and also for server identification, to ensure that the user agent sends confidential information only to trusted servers.  For StoreFront, the conversation starts with a Request Security Token (RST) message [1] to an endpoint obtained from the client as part of the Protocol Choices message [1]. A successful conversation ends with a Request Security Token Response (RSTR) message [1]. The conversation can also end with a failure form, an HTTP status code other than 200, or a network failure.  For the rest of the conversation the server returns authentication forms described in Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language v2.0 [4].  Note to client implementors: Because a client does not know when a conversation will end, it should always set the HTTP Accept header to include both the Form and RSTR types.",

            "text": "URL: Usually obtained from the Protocol Choices data  HTTP Method: POST  Authentication: None  Request Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml  Accept:  application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml,   application/vnd.citrix.authenticateresponse-1+xml     Because the conversation persists over several HTTP requests, the initial conversation start may include a Set-Cookie header. The usual HTTP semantics apply to this cookie, as described above. In addition, various aspects of the conversation are negotiated at the start of the conversation through the use of HTTP headers, as discussed below:  Credential Type Negotiation  The Common Forms Language [4] contains a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration for the credential types, which means that new credential types can be added without breaking the schema. The behavior of user agents is to reject forms with unknown credential types. Hence credential types need to be negotiated between the client and server using the following HTTP header:  credential-Types-Header =  X-Citrix-AM-CredentialTypes   :  field-value\nfield-value = *LWS credential-types-value *LWS\ncredential-types-value = 1#( credential-type-value )\ncredential-type-value = *TEXT  The credential types header is a comma-separated list of credential types that the client supports.  Example: \n       X-Citrix-AM-CredentialTypes: none, username, domain, password, newpassword,\n                                passcode, savecredentials, textcredential  New clients will use the above HTTP header to signal the credential types that are known in a comma-separated list. Older clients do not set this header, so if the header is missing then the following credential types will be assumed: none, username, domain, password, newpassword, passcode, savecredentials, textcredential.\nIf a client does not support a required credential type, then the behavior is defined by the form implementation on the server, which may choose to terminate the conversation, or supply a simplified form that the client can process.  Label Type Negotiation  The Common Forms Language [4] contains a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration for the label types, which means that new label types can be added without breaking the schema. Label types can be negotiated between the client and server using the following HTTP header:  label-Types-Header =  X-Citrix-AM-LabelTypes   :  field-value\nfield-value = *LWS label-types-value *LWS\nlabel-types-value = 1#( label-type )\nlabel-type = *TEXT  The label types header is a comma-separated list of label values that the client supports.  Example:          X-Citrix-AM-LabelTypes: none, plain, heading, information, warning,\n                           error, confirmation  New clients will use the above HTTP header to signal the label types that are known in a comma-separated list. Older clients do not set this header, so if the header is missing then the following label types shall be assumed: none, plain, heading, information, warning, error, confirmation.\nIf a client does not support a required label type, then the behavior is defined by the form implementation on the server, which may choose to terminate the conversation, or supply a simplified form that the client can process.\nNotes regarding images:   The default list of label types does not contain image. This is because none of the known legacy clients supported rendering images.  Images are intended for authentication purposes, such as captcha images, and are not intended for generic branding.  The image data supplied in the form is to be interpreted as a Data URI as defined by RFC 2397, [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397]   Language Negotiation  The textual data displayed in the form is defined by the StoreFront Server. In order to supply text in the appropriate language for the user, the server supports the standard HTTP language negotiation mechanism through the use of the Accept-Language header as described in RFC 2616 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616].  Accept-Language-Header =  Accept-Language   :  field-value\nfield-value = *LWS accept-language-value *LWS\naccept-language-value = 1#( language-range [  ;   q   =  qvalue ] )\nlanguage-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *(  -  1*8ALPHA ) ) |  *  )  The header value may include a comma-separated list of language ranges. Each language range may be given an associated quality value that represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages specified by that range. The quality value defaults to \"q=1\"\nExample:         Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7  Should be interpreted as: \"I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and other types of English.\"  If a language cannot be negotiated, then a default language will be used, typically English.",

Storage-Header =  X-Citrix-AM-Storage   :  field-value\nfield-value = *LWS storage-value *LWS\nstorage-value = *TEXT  The header value may include leading and trailing whitespace, which should be ignored, and the storage value is a plain text string. The storage value may be omitted entirely, leaving a header with an empty value.  Each X-Citrix-AM-Storage header represents a value stored by the user agent on behalf of the specific authentication service. Each authentication service may store only one value, but a client that interacts with multiple authentication services must be able store one value for each service. An authentication service is identified by the start URL of a forms conversation, including scheme, hostname, port number and path, but excluding query strings and fragments. The URLs of subsequent requests in a forms auth conversation are likely to differ from the start URL so clients must be careful not to simply use the current request URL in making decisions about storage.  Clients must compare URLs in accordance with the URI comparison rules defined in RFC 2616 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616].   Note: a client may authenticate against a third party authentication service through Delegated Forms Authentication using different start URLs, for example one URL for NetScaler Gateway and one URL for StoreFront. In this case the third authentication service will end up setting two storage values on the client. This is conceptually not ideal but it should be sufficient because the main goal is parity with HTTP cookie-based authentication methods.  The X-Citrix-AM-Storage header is only valid during a forms-based authentication conversation. Clients should not update storage or send a storage value outside the authentication conversation. Clients should update the storage value if the header is received on any valid forms response during the conversation, including: failure forms (for example a \u2018fail\u2019 or \u2018cancel\u2019 result, or failure status) and Request Token Responses.\nThere is no mechanism for a client to advertise that it supports persistent storage, other than by returning a previously stored value.  Notes to server implementors:\n- It is the server implementor\u2019s responsibility to appropriately protect the data stored on the client, for example using HMACs if data origin and integrity are important, or encryption if privacy is also required.\n- The maximum size of the storage header on an HTTP response is 5016 bytes, including the header name and whitespace around the value.  Note to client implementors: Clients should treat a storage value as an opaque string and should not attempt to interpret the value. The content of a storage value is meaningful only to the originating server.",

If the X-Citrix-AM-Storage response header has an empty value, then clients should delete the storage value for the sending authentication service; subsequently clients do not need to send the empty X-Citrix-AM-Storage header.  If a forms response does not include an X-Citrix-AM-Storage header, clients must assume that there is no change required, and must keep the current storage value unchanged, and continue to send the last seen value.  If the response is not a valid forms response or is otherwise not understood by the client, the client must ignore any X-Citrix-AM-Storage header and not update the storage value.  Servers should not include more than one X-Citrix-AM-Storage header in the same response. If multiple storage headers are received, clients should process the first one only.  Storage values do not have an explicit or implicit expiry date and potentially may be retained indefinitely.

The extension auth-scheme is CitrixAuth and is case-sensitive. It uses the standard HTTP Authorization and WWW-Authenticate HTTP headers as defined in RFC2617.\n\n\nThe headers have the following formats, in conformance with RFC2617:\n\n\nAuthorization: CitrixAuth {security-token}\n\n\nIf no valid Authorization header for the CitrixAuth scheme is found for the realm of the service it is sent to, then a challenge shall be issued as follows:\n\n\nWWW-Authenticate: CitrixAuth realm=\n{service-id}\n , reqtokentemplate=\n{template}\n, \n                             reason=\n{reason-description}\n,locations=\n{url-list}\n,\n                             serviceroot-hint=\u201d{service-root}\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe parameters are defined by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{service-id}\n\n\nThe unique identifier of the consuming service. With the hostname of the service being accessed it defines a Protection Space as per RFC2617 section 1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{security-token}\n\n\nThe serialized security token used to authenticate the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{template}\n\n\nThis is a string that shall be passed by the client to the server when requesting a token for a specific service. The server can use this value to determine the token format to use. This value should be empty for current implementations, but must still be passed to the server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{reason-description}\n\n\nThe reason why a challenge has been issued. This is to assist the client with managing cached tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{url-list}\n\n\nAn ordered list of URLs separated by the \u2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{serviceroot}\n\n\nA hint for the client as to the root URL for the protection space associated with the current request. This simplifies the client decision-making regarding sending cached tokens to respond to the challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason-description may be one of the following values:\n\n\n\n\nnotoken: No authentication token was supplied.\n\n\nexpired: The supplied token is no longer valid.\n\n\nnotforthisservice: The token is valid, but was not issued for the service trying to consume it.\n\n\nnottrusted: A valid token has been issued by a service that the consumer does not trust.\n\n\ninvalidtoken: The token extracted from the Authorization header was invalid, for example it may be badly formed.\n\n\npasswordClaimNotFound: A required password claim was not found.\n\n\nbadpassword: For a password-based token, the password has been changed or has expired since the token was issued and is no longer valid.\n\n\nbadaccount: The account associated with the subject was invalid, for example it may be locked out.\n\n\ninvalidAudience: The original token was not requested for a valid audience (see below).\n\n\ntokenSignatureNotVerified: The signature of the token could not be verified.\n\n\nwrongclaims: The token does not contain the required claims.\n\n\ngatewayclaimsinconsistent: The gateway identified in the supplied token does not match the gateway discovered by the relying party.\n\n\n\n\nProtection Space\n\n\nRFC2617 section 1.2 defines a Protection Space as the domain over which credentials can be automatically applied. If a prior request has been authorized, the same credentials may be reused for all other requests within that protection space for a period of time determined by the authentication scheme, parameters, and/or user preference. The CitrixAuth scheme is consistent with other schemes in that a single protection space cannot extend outside the scope of its server. The CitrixAuth scheme uses both the service-id (Realm) and the audience to which the request is to be sent, to define a protection space, and the client should not automatically send credentials to services outside of the protection space defined for a particular credential. In this context, the audience is defined by the scheme, host name, and port associated with the original request.\nThe serviceroot-hint in the challenge provides the client with the root of the protection space for the current request. This enables a better caching strategy in the client, if the initial request is not to the root of the protection space.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe following illustrates a CitrixAuth challenge and response:\n\n\nRequest to the Relying Party\n\n\nGET https://www.example.com/Citrix/Store/resources/v2/T2VvUndOMEZMM1VBK2NpYzY4PQ--/image/16 HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAccept: image/png\n\n\n\n\nResponse from the Relying Party\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: CitrixAuth realm=\n6b78ab94-a709-4e3a-8b9b-a49ca317c70c\n,\n                             reqtokentemplate=\n, reason=\nnotoken\n, \n                             locations=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n,\n                             serviceroot-hint=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Store2/resources/v2\n\n\n\n\nThe client uses the information in the challenge to obtain an appropriate security token for the Service Provider, and then resends the original request with an attached Authorization header, as follows:\n\n\nGET https://www.example.com/Citrix/Store/resources/v2/T2VvUndOMEZMM1VBK2NpYzY4PQ--/image/16 HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAccept: image/png\nAuthorization: CitrixAuth H4sIAAAAAAAEAO29B2AcSZYlJi9tynt/SvVK1+B0oQiAYBMk2JBAEOzBiM3mku\u2026\n\n\n\n\nResponse from the Relying Party\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: image/png\nCache-Control: public, no-store, max-age=0\nContent-Length: 773\n\n\nbinary data\n\n\n\n\nClient Processing of a Challenge\n\n\nWhen a client receives a CitrixAuth challenge, it must respond by sending a Request Security Token message to the location specified in the challenge.

            "text": "Citrix Common Authentication Forms Language\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nCitrix has devised a common authentication protocol that is implemented by its next generation services and gateway platforms, referred to here as StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway. Citrix is implementing client support for this common authentication protocol in native user-agents, such as Receiver and Worx, for the major device platforms, notably: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Receiver for Web for browser based user-agents.\n\n\nAn important part of the common authentication protocol is a generic forms language, designed to allow third parties to express a wide range of authentication forms using a set of user interface constructs that are similar to basic HTML forms, see RFC 1867 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt] and 2388 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388.txt] for more details.\n\n\nThird parties can extend the authentication methods supported by StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway by implementing server logic that emits and consumes forms defined in the common forms language, see the Citrix Authentication Software Development Kit [1] for more details.\n\n\nThis document is intended for Citrix partners to understand the current expressivity of the common forms language, with the intent to allow them to customize the existing form definitions and to create new forms.\n\n\nReceiver Forms Language Overview\n\n\nAuthentication forms are logical forms expressed in Xml, the schema for which is located at: /Schemas/CommonFormsSchema.xsd.\n\n\nThe client controls the rendered form\u2019s layout with minimal hints from the server. These hints define the font size for different types of display text. Enough semantic information is contained in the form description to allow clients to handle credential types appropriately, and to enable credentials to be saved on client machines if permissible.\n\n\nForm Structure\n\n\nThe form is structured such that there is a control block, followed a section for authentication requirements.\n\n\nControl Block\n\n\nThe form contains the following control information:\n\n\n\n\n contains any state information that the server wishes the client to hold and pass back with the response to the form.\n\n\n represents the current state of the overall authentication process through a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration.\n\n\n represents a \"soft\" enumeration of status codes for the current request.\n\n\n  is an optional, localized, message from the server to be displayed, and/or logged by the client.\n\n\n\n\nThe following table describes the known result states:\n\n\nmore-info\nMore information is required by the server. The form contains authentication requirements that should be collected by the client and returned to the server.\nfail\nThe authentication conversation has failed. There may be a \nLogMessage> to indicate the issue.\nsuccess\nThe authentication conversation succeeded\ncancelled\nThe authentication conversation was cancelled directly by the user, or indirectly by the user-agent.\nupdate-credentials\nThe user is required to update a credential, such as a password. The form will contain authentication requirements that should be collected by the client and returned to the server.\n\n\n\nThe following table describes the known status states:\n\n\nsuccess\nThe last form POST was successfully processed.\nerror-service-unavailable\nThe service is unavailable\nerror-internal-failure\nAn internal error occurred.\nerror-params-not-expected\nOne or more of the parameters was unexpected.\nerror-logon-point-unknown\nThe logon point is unknown.\nerror-sessionid-invalid\nThe associated Http Session state is invalid.\nerror-sessionid-expired\nThe associated Http Session state has expired.\nerror-state-context-invalid\nThe session context value was invalid.\n\n\n\nAuthentication Requirements\n\n\nThe first part of the authentication requirements contains information regarding where to send the form response:\n\n\n\n\nThe Url to post the form response to\n\n\nThe Url to post a cancel request to\n\n\nThe optional text for the cancel button\n\n\n\n\nThe details of how to process the form and construct a form response, can be found in the document: Citrix Common Forms API [2].\n\n\nThe authentication requirements are expressed as an ordered collection of \n elements, which should generally be arranged in vertical order by the client when displayed. Each requirement element can define: a named credential value, an associated input field, a label, and assistive text. Where desired, the credential and input field can be omitted so the label is used for a heading, message or explanatory text. Common user interaction widgets are supported for input fields: single line clear text edit fields, single line obscured text edit fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, combo-boxes, and submit buttons.\n\n\nCredential Types\n\n\nThe credential types supported are a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration, which means that new credential types can be added without breaking the schema. The mechanism for how credential types are negotiated between the client and the server is described in the document: Citrix Common Forms API [2].\n\n\nThe default credential types are described below. Semantic information is implied for some credential types, to allow clients to provide enhanced handling and other functions.\n\n\nnone\nUsed for read-only and non-textual input controls.\nusername\nThe user name which may be qualified, e.g. an Active Directory user principal name such as \nuser@fully.qualified.domain\n or \u00a0legacy LAN Manager account such as domain\\username.\ndomain\nExpected to be an Active Directory domain name, examples include: the shorter legacy LAN Manager format, the fully qualified domain name, or an alternate domain name.\npassword\nTextual password or passphrase.\nnewpassword\nNew password in a change password form.\npin\nTextual password, likely a short numeric PIN.\ntextcredential\nGeneric text value with no implied semantics.\nsavecredentials\nControl flag for clients that support saving credentials locally.\nrealm\nSynonym for domain.\nrsa-passcode\nThe current RSA passcode.\nrsa-next-passcode\nThe next RSA passcode.\nrsa-next-tokencode\nSecondary RSA tokencode, triggered by one or more invalid tokencodes.\nrsa-pin\nThe RSA PIN, used during user generated PIN change.\n\n\n\nLabel Types\n\n\nThe label types supported are a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration, which means that new label types can be added without breaking the schema. The mechanism for how label types are negotiated between the client and the server is described in the document: Citrix Common Forms API [2].\n\n\nLabels can be textual or binary. The only built-in support for binary labels is for images [Label type: image]\n\n\nNotes regarding Images:\n\n\n\n\nImages are intended for authentication purposes, such as captcha images, and are not intended for generic branding\n\n\nThe image data supplied in the form is to be interpreted as a Data Uri as defined by RFC 2397, [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt]\n\n\n\n\nThe following describes the built-in text based labels:\n\n\nnone\nNo label is associated with the requirement\nplain\nNormal font.\nheading\nHeading font, with appropriate vertical spacing.\ninformation\nNormal font\nwarning\nWarning font\nerror\nError font\nconfirmation\nNormal font\n\n\n\nNotes regarding text based labels:\n\n\n\n\nIf a label type is: none, any textual or binary data specified for the associate label shall be ignored.\n\n\nClient implementors may use the label type to decorate messages with icons for visual effect.\n\n\nA limited set of inline font markup is supported, within text labels, using standard HTML tags such as: \nb\n for bold, \ni\n for italic, and \nu\n for underline. Note: these style tags must be XML encoded or contained within a CDATA section.\n\n\nMessages will flow across multiple lines of display if necessary.\n\n\nClient implementations may strip trailing \u2018:\u2019 if specified by the form author\n\n\nIf a label corresponds to an error message, then optionally, the label can also contain a list of credential identifier for requirements associated with the error, that the client can use to highlight the requirements for the users attention.\n\n\n\n\nError Highlight Example\n\n\nConsider a change password form with a requirement for the user to re-enter their existing password:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\noldPassword\n/ID\n\n    \nType\npassword\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nOld password:\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nText\n\n      \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n      \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n      \nInitialValue\n/InitialValue\n\n      \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n    \n/Text\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the user enters an invalid value, then an error label is returned that specifies the oldpassword requirement to be highlighted:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nHighlightFields\n\n      \nCredentialID\noldPassword\n/CredentialID\n\n    \n/HighlightFields\n\n    \nText\nOld password incorrect\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nerror\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput /\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is displayed in Receiver for Windows as:\n\n\nRequirement Element Idioms\n\n\nExamples of the common types of Requirement elements are shown below. Element values that are highlighted identify variable names or user-visible labels that are controlled by the author of the authentication form. Element values that are bolded and underscored indicate field enumeration types defined in this document.\n\n\nCancel Button\n\n\nThe assumption is that forms shall normally have a cancel button, positioned in the natural location for each client platform, relative to the other buttons. However, the cancel button will only be shown if the element is present at: /AuthenticateResponse/AuthenticationRequirements/CancelButtonText.\n\n\nNotes:\n- If a form author specifies CancelButtonText, client implementors may still not show a cancel button if it is not appropriate for the device.\n- The absence of CancelButtonText doesn\u2019t preclude the user-agent sending a cancellation request.\n\n\nHeading\n\n\nThis example is for a change password form. If a heading is not included as the first requirement element in a form, Receiver clients may provide a default heading that is tailored according to the user action that initiated the authentication process.  \n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nChange Password\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nheading\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput /\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nMessage\n\n\nThis example is for an expired password message, added to a change password form for explanation. \n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nYour password has \nlt;b\ngt;expired\nlt;/b\ngt; and must be changed\n/Text\n\n    \nType\ninformation\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput /\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nClear Text Credential\n\n\nThis example is for a user name credential type, but could be for a domain or generic value.\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\nusername\n/ID\n\n    \nSaveID\nExplicitForms-Username\n/SaveID\n\n    \nType\nusername\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nUsername:\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nText\n\n      \nSecret\nfalse\n/Secret\n\n      \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n      \nInitialValue\n/InitialValue\n\n      \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n    \n/Text\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nNote: Client implementations may ignore the constraints specified by the form author.\n\n\nSecret Text Credential\n\n\nThis credential must keep what the user types a secret, like an \ninput\n field of type password in Html.\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\npassword\n/ID\n\n    \nSaveID\nExplicitForms-Password\n/SaveID\n\n    \nType\npassword\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nPassword:\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nText\n\n      \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n      \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n      \nInitialValue\n/InitialValue\n\n      \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n    \n/Text\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nCheckbox\n\n\nThis is one of several input types that typically uses the credential type: none.\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\nuserConsent\n/ID\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nAccept terms and conditions\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nCheckBox\n\n      \nInitialValue\nfalse\n/InitialValue\n\n    \n/CheckBox\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nRadio Button\n\n\nThe following demonstrates a series of radio buttons, for the user to select a single item from a set of choices.

distinguished from other generic credential collection forms, by having a distinct \n code in the control block. This is needed so that Receivers which support saving credentials can react appropriately. It includes the user name value as a read-only credential input, and submit both password and newpassword credential values. This form also illustrates the ability to have pre-filled and read-only input fields.\n\n\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nUTF-8\n?\n\n\nAuthenticateResponse xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/authentication/response/1\n\n  \nStatus\nsuccess\n/Status\n\n  \nResult\nupdate-credentials\n/Result\n\n  \nStateContext/\n\n  \nAuthenticationRequirements\n\n    \nPostBack\n/Citrix/Authentication/ExplicitForms\n/PostBack\n\n    \nCancelPostBack\n/Citrix/Authentication/ExplicitForms/Cancel\n/CancelPostBack\n\n    \nCancelButtonText\nCancel\n/CancelButtonText\n\n    \nRequirements\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nText\nChange Expired Password\n/Text\n\n          \nType\nheading\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput /\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nType\nusername\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nText\nUser name:\n/Text\n\n          \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nText\n\n            \nSecret\nfalse\n/Secret\n\n            \nReadOnly\ntrue\n/ReadOnly\n\n            \nInitialValue\nanimaniacs\\expiredpassword\n/InitialValue\n\n            \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n          \n/Text\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nID\noldPassword\n/ID\n\n          \nType\npassword\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nText\nOld password:\n/Text\n\n          \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nText\n\n            \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n            \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n            \nInitialValue\n/InitialValue\n\n            \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n          \n/Text\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nID\nnewPassword\n/ID\n\n          \nSaveID\nExplicitForms-Password\n/SaveID\n\n          \nType\nnewpassword\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nText\nNew password:\n/Text\n\n          \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nText\n\n            \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n            \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n            \nInitialValue\n/InitialValue\n\n            \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n          \n/Text\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nID\nconfirmPassword\n/ID\n\n          \nType\nnewpassword\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nText\nConfirm password:\n/Text\n\n          \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nText\n\n            \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n            \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n            \nInitialValue\n/InitialValue\n\n            \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n          \n/Text\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n      \nRequirement\n\n        \nCredential\n\n          \nID\nchangePasswordBtn\n/ID\n\n          \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n        \n/Credential\n\n        \nLabel\n\n          \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n        \n/Label\n\n        \nInput\n\n          \nButton\nOK\n/Button\n\n        \n/Input\n\n      \n/Requirement\n\n    \n/Requirements\n\n  \n/AuthenticationRequirements\n\n\n/AuthenticateResponse\n\n\n\n\nConfirmation Message\n\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates a message display form that is used to provide important user feedback, such as when the users password has been changed in the example above.

Citrix is implementing client support for this common authentication protocol in native user-agents, such as Receiver and Worx, for the major device platforms, notably: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Receiver for Web for browser based user-agents.  An important part of the common authentication protocol is a generic forms language, designed to allow third parties to express a wide range of authentication forms using a set of user interface constructs that are similar to basic HTML forms, see RFC 1867 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt] and 2388 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388.txt] for more details.  Third parties can extend the authentication methods supported by StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway by implementing server logic that emits and consumes forms defined in the common forms language, see the Citrix Authentication Software Development Kit [1] for more details.  This document is intended for Citrix partners to understand the current expressivity of the common forms language, with the intent to allow them to customize the existing form definitions and to create new forms.",

The authentication requirements are expressed as an ordered collection of   elements, which should generally be arranged in vertical order by the client when displayed. Each requirement element can define: a named credential value, an associated input field, a label, and assistive text. Where desired, the credential and input field can be omitted so the label is used for a heading, message or explanatory text. Common user interaction widgets are supported for input fields: single line clear text edit fields, single line obscured text edit fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, combo-boxes, and submit buttons.  Credential Types  The credential types supported are a \u201csoft\u201d enumeration, which means that new credential types can be added without breaking the schema. The mechanism for how credential types are negotiated between the client and the server is described in the document: Citrix Common Forms API [2].  The default credential types are described below. Semantic information is implied for some credential types, to allow clients to provide enhanced handling and other functions.  none Used for read-only and non-textual input controls. username The user name which may be qualified, e.g. an Active Directory user principal name such as  user@fully.qualified.domain  or \u00a0legacy LAN Manager account such as domain\\username. domain Expected to be an Active Directory domain name, examples include: the shorter legacy LAN Manager format, the fully qualified domain name, or an alternate domain name. password Textual password or passphrase. newpassword New password in a change password form. pin Textual password, likely a short numeric PIN. textcredential Generic text value with no implied semantics. savecredentials Control flag for clients that support saving credentials locally. realm Synonym for domain. rsa-passcode The current RSA passcode. rsa-next-passcode The next RSA passcode. rsa-next-tokencode Secondary RSA tokencode, triggered by one or more invalid tokencodes. rsa-pin The RSA PIN, used during user generated PIN change.",

            "text": "Security Token Services API\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nScope\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the StoreFront Security Token Services Application Programming Interface.\n\n\nIdentity Management Systems\n\n\nTraditional systems have centralized identity management systems and each application is responsible for authenticating the user and establishing their identity. This has led to multiple implementations of authentication and authorization systems and applications with differing levels of support for different protocols.\n\n\nIn federated systems the user authenticates once, to an appropriate authentication service, which gathers information regarding the user. This information often takes the form of assertions or claims regarding the user. The claims are then marshalled to other applications or services that rely on the authentication service by a defined set of messages. These \"relying parties\" have been configured to trust the assertions/claims issued by the authentication service, or \"trusted issuer\" and this is commonly enforced by strong cryptographic means such as digital signing and encipherment. The assertions/claims are marshalled as security tokens that are issued by the trusted issuer, held by the application, and presented to other services to gain access to data and services.\n\n\nThe security tokens should be considered to be an opaque blob from which the client should not expect to derive any information. The security tokens are sensitive because they can be used to gain access to resources on the user\u2019s behalf with no additional authentication and are commonly described as \u201cbearer tokens\u201d. Hence it is the client\u2019s responsibility to securely store the token and to not disclose it to inappropriate services.\n\n\nIn the general case, different services will require different security tokens. This is a result of the requirement for the authentication service to encipher the private data so that only the specified relying service can decipher it. This leads to a general interaction pattern where there are a set of authentication endpoints that issue a \u201cprimary\u201d security token to the client. The client can then use this primary authentication token to request specific tokens for specific services from a token-granting service. The client can then present this token to the required service to gain access to data and services.\n\n\nTo facilitate changing the token wire representations, a set of abstract interfaces have been defined, which individual \"Token Providers\" will be required to implement along with base implementations to reduce the amount of new code to be written. Note that although the wire representations are designed to be changeable, the final serialized form is expected to be a Base64 encoded string (see RFC 4648 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648]), to enable easy transport within HTTP requests and responses.\n\n\nThe remainder of this document describes the various endpoints associated with the issuing of security tokens and the messages used to interact with security token services.\n\n\nGeneral Interaction Pattern\n\n\n\n\nThe following sequence diagram illustrates how the client and server interact to obtain and use the security tokens, through the exchange of strongly typed messages that are defined in this document.\n\n\nIn general, the sequence is triggered by a client accessing a protected URL and receiving a CitrixAuth challenge, which is further described in the CitrixAuth Authentication Scheme v1.2 document. The client should expect to be challenged at any time when accessing endpoints within the StoreFront or CloudGateway solution.\n\n\nIt is the clients\u2019 responsibility to parse this information and to create the Request Token message, which is described below. This message should then be sent to the authentication service URL to obtain the required security token by means of a HTTP POST. This token is returned as part of the Request Token Response, also described below.\n\n\nThe client may be directed to an URL to perform primary authentication at which time they may receive a HTTP Multiple choices response as a Request Token Choices message, defined below. It is the clients\u2019 responsibility to understand this data and to choose an authentication protocol and associated URL to authenticate to.\n\n\nSecurity Token Messages\n\n\nThe conversation between the client and services is a series, or conversation, of strongly typed messages, described below:\n\n\n\n\nRequest Token: This message is sent from the client to the authentication service to request a token for a specific service.\n\n\nRefresh Token: This message is sent from the client to the authentication service to request that a token be refreshed, that is, the token validity period is extended.\n\n\nRequest Token Response: This message is returned by the authentication service in response to a Request Token or a Refresh Token message, and returns a token to the client.\n\n\nDestroy Token: This message is sent by the client to the authentication service to tell the service to destroy any server-side state held by the service for a specific token.\n\n\nDestroy Token Response: This message is returned by the authentication service in response to a Destroy Token message and details the status of the token that was the subject of the Destroy Token message.\n\n\nRequest Token Choices: This message is returned by the authentication service in response to a Request Token message. It details the available choices for primary authentication in order to obtain a token.\n\n\n\n\nThe messages are now described in more detail.\n\n\nRequest Token\n\n\nThe following information is required by the authentication and token-for-service processes in order to be able to construct the correct security token. The data is sent as XML in the body of the POST, the schema for which can be found at: /Schemas/RequestToken.xsd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor-service\n\n\nYes\n\n\nA string identifying the service for which the requested token is targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor-service-url\n\n\nYes\n\n\nA string representing the URL of the service, from the client\u2019s perspective, for which the token is being requested\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreqtokentemplate\n\n\nYes\n\n\nThe required template for the claims in the token. This may be empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequested-lifetime\n\n\nOptional\n\n\nThe requested lifetime for the token.

Examples may be: SPNEGO negotiate challenge-responses, HTML forms for forms-based protocols. However, the conversation must always start with the client sending a Request Token Response message, and must always end with the server returning a Request Token Response message.\n\n\n\n\nRequest Security Token\n\n\n\n\nURL: /auth/v1/token\n\n\nHTTP Method: POST\n\n\nAuthentication: CitrixAuth\n\n\nRequest Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\n\n\nResponse Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml\n\n\n\n\nRequest a security token for the service specified in the Request Token. The token for the required service is returned in the Request Token Response.\n\n\nRefresh Security Token\n\n\n\n\nURL: /auth/v1/token\n\n\nHTTP Method: POST\n\n\nAuthentication: CitrixAuth\n\n\nRequest Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.refreshtoken+xml\n\n\nResponse Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml\n\n\n\n\nRefresh the specified security token by extending its lifetime by the requested amount. A token can be refreshed up to the maximum lifetime period specified by the administrator. This request is protected by the CitrixAuth protocol, and the authorization token need not be the same as the token being refreshed. The refreshed token is returned in the Request Token Response.\n\n\nDestroy Security Token\n\n\n\n\nURL: /auth/v1/token\n\n\nHTTP Method: POST\n\n\nAuthentication: CitrixAuth\n\n\nRequest Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.destroytoken+xml\n\n\nResponse Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.destroytokenresponse+xml\n\n\n\n\nDestroy the server-side data associated with the specified token. This request is protected by the CitrixAuth protocol, and the authorization token need not be the same as the token being destroyed. Note: This doesn\u2019t revoke the security token, but just releases any server-held resources.\n\n\nToken Validation\n\n\n\n\nURL: /auth/v1/token/validate/{tokenValidationServiceId}\n\n\nHTTP Method: GET\n\n\nAuthentication: CitrixAuth\n\n\nResponse Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.claimsidentity+xml\n\n\n\n\nReturn a filtered list of claims extracted from the CitrixAuth authorization token, if the the token is valid. The filtering of the claims is controlled by the administrator of the service.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n{tokenValidationServiceId} denotes a parameter used to identify a particular token validation service. This parameter can be omitted, in which case the value default is used to identify the default token validation service. The default token validation service is utilised by Citrix Merchandising Servers to enable single sign-on. It can also be used to extract information regarding the claims in the primary token, if allowed by the server.\n\n\n\n\nCloudGateway AppControllers also utilize the token validation service. For AppControllers the {tokenValidationServiceId} parameter should be the fully qualified host name associated with the AppController.\n\n\nWire-Level Examples\n\n\nRequest to the Service Provider\n\n\nThe following  \u201cwire-level\u201d example shows all the HTTP requests and responses when a client attempts to access a protected service (the resources service) and has to obtain security tokens to be granted access.\n\n\nRequest to Service Provider\n\n\nGET https://www.example.com/resources/v2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.resources+xml\nResponse from Service Provider\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nCache-Control: public, no-store, max-age=0\nWWW-Authenticate: CitrixAuth realm=\n6b78ab94-a709-4e3a-8b9b-a49ca317c70c\n,\n                             reqtokentemplate=\n, reason=\nnotoken\n,\n                             locations=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n,\n                             serviceroot-hint=https://www.example.com/Citrix/Store/resources/v2\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the client has to take the information provided in the CitrixAuth challenge and construct a Request for Security Token message to be POSTed to the URL specified in the challenge.\n\n\nRequest to Authentication Service\n\n\nPOST https://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml, application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenchoices+xml\nContent-Encoding: utf-8\nHost: www.example.com\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttoken xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttoken\n\n  \nfor-service\n6b78ab94-a709-4e3a-8b9b-a49ca317c70c\n/for-service\n\n  \nfor-service-url\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Store/resources/v2\n/for-service-url\n\n  \nreqtokentemplate /\n\n  \nrequested-lifetime\n1.06:00:00\n/requested-lifetime\n\n\n/requesttoken\n\n\n\n\nResponse from Service Provider\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nCache-Control: public, no-store, max-age=0\nWWW-Authenticate: CitrixAuth realm=\n32f585f3-054d-4ee5-a714-b0e11e312308\n,\n                     reqtokentemplate=\n, reason=\nnotoken\n   \n                     locations=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/protocols\n,\n                     serviceroot-hint=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n\n\nHence, the result of this sequence is another challenge, because the client has not presented the security token required to access the token issuing service. The client must therefore parse the challenge again to construct another Request Security Token message and POST it to the indicated URI, as follows:\nRequest to Authentication Service\nPOST https://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/protocols HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml, application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenchoices+xml\nContent-Encoding: utf-8\nHost: www.example.com\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttoken xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttoken\n\n  \nfor-service\n32f585f3-054d-4ee5-a714-b0e11e312308\n/for-service\n\n  \nfor-service-url\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n/for-service-url\n\n  \nreqtokentemplate /\n\n  \nrequested-lifetime\n1.06:00:00\n/requested-lifetime\n\n\n/requesttoken\n\n\n\n\nResponse from Service Provider\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices\nCache-Control: public, no-store, max-age=0\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenchoices+xml\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttokenchoices xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttokenchoices\n\n  \nchoices\n\n    \nchoice\n\n      \nprotocol\nExplicitForms\n/protocol\n\n      \nlocation\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/ExplicitForms/Authenticate\n/location\n\n    \n/choice\n\n  \n/choices\n\n\n/requesttokenchoices\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the authentication service has responded with a HTTP 300 (Multiple Choices) response, indicating that the security token can be obtained from a choice of URIs.

            "text": "Traditional systems have centralized identity management systems and each application is responsible for authenticating the user and establishing their identity. This has led to multiple implementations of authentication and authorization systems and applications with differing levels of support for different protocols.  In federated systems the user authenticates once, to an appropriate authentication service, which gathers information regarding the user. This information often takes the form of assertions or claims regarding the user. The claims are then marshalled to other applications or services that rely on the authentication service by a defined set of messages. These \"relying parties\" have been configured to trust the assertions/claims issued by the authentication service, or \"trusted issuer\" and this is commonly enforced by strong cryptographic means such as digital signing and encipherment. The assertions/claims are marshalled as security tokens that are issued by the trusted issuer, held by the application, and presented to other services to gain access to data and services.  The security tokens should be considered to be an opaque blob from which the client should not expect to derive any information. The security tokens are sensitive because they can be used to gain access to resources on the user\u2019s behalf with no additional authentication and are commonly described as \u201cbearer tokens\u201d. Hence it is the client\u2019s responsibility to securely store the token and to not disclose it to inappropriate services.  In the general case, different services will require different security tokens. This is a result of the requirement for the authentication service to encipher the private data so that only the specified relying service can decipher it. This leads to a general interaction pattern where there are a set of authentication endpoints that issue a \u201cprimary\u201d security token to the client. The client can then use this primary authentication token to request specific tokens for specific services from a token-granting service. The client can then present this token to the required service to gain access to data and services.  To facilitate changing the token wire representations, a set of abstract interfaces have been defined, which individual \"Token Providers\" will be required to implement along with base implementations to reduce the amount of new code to be written. Note that although the wire representations are designed to be changeable, the final serialized form is expected to be a Base64 encoded string (see RFC 4648 [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648]), to enable easy transport within HTTP requests and responses.

The client should expect to be challenged at any time when accessing endpoints within the StoreFront or CloudGateway solution.  It is the clients\u2019 responsibility to parse this information and to create the Request Token message, which is described below. This message should then be sent to the authentication service URL to obtain the required security token by means of a HTTP POST. This token is returned as part of the Request Token Response, also described below.

            "text": "Introduction\n\n\nCitrix has devised a common authentication protocol that is implemented by its next generation services and gateway platforms, referred to here as StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway. Citrix has implemented client support for this common authentication protocol in native user agents, such as Receiver and Worx, for the major device platforms, notably Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Receiver for Web for browser-based user agents.\n\n\nAn important part of the common authentication protocol is a generic forms language, which is described in the Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language document [2]. This language is designed to allow third parties to express a wide range of authentication forms using a set of user interface constructs that are similar to basic HTML forms; see RFC 1867 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt] and 2388 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388.txt] for more details.\n\n\nThird parties can extend the authentication methods supported by StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway by implementing server logic that emits and consumes forms defined in the common forms language; see the Citrix Authentication Software Development Kit [1] for more details.\n\n\nThis document aims to enable Citrix partners to understand how StoreFront generates the formsand to enable them to customize the existing form definitions, create new forms, and new sequences of forms to create new authentication conversations.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nForms-based authentication is a conversation using the HTTP protocol where the client responds to a series of forms generated by the server to establish an identity on the server. The HTTP API is described in the Citrix Common Forms API document [3]. There are several StoreFront components that interact to achieve the generation of the forms and the handling of the HTTP responses. \n\n\nStoreFront makes extensive use of service location and inversion-of-control (IoC) containers; see http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html for more details of this software pattern.\n\n\n\n\nForms Generation Components for a conversation requiring Active Directory credential validation\n\n\nHandling HTTP requests and responses is the responsibility of a small set of built-in MVCs (model view controllers). In most cases there will be no need for custom form implementers to implement new controllers. For general forms, where there is no requirement to validate Active Directory credentials, the FormsAuthenticationController ASP.Net MVC controller should be used. If validating Active Directory credentials is required, then the ExplicitFormsAuthenticationController controller should be used. The MVC controllers validate the requests and extract the state associated with the conversation and then construct and invoke the conversation engine.\n\n\nThe conversation engine is responsible for running the conversation, which includes creating the appropriate conversation object and dispatching messages to it. There are two built-in conversation engines: ConversationEngine, used when validating Active Directory credentials is not required, and ExplicitConversationEngine, used when validating Active Directory credentials is required. Again, it is not anticipated that custom forms implementers will need to modify the conversation engine functionality.\n\n\nThe configuration for the MVC route includes the name, used by the Service Locator to find a class that implements the IFormsConversationFactory interface, stored in the IoC container. The appropriate conversation engine uses this to locate the custom conversation factory that uses any settings required, to create a new custom conversation object.\n\n\nThe custom conversation object is responsible for orchestrating the sequence of forms and dispatching messages to appropriate form objects. It is expected that custom forms implementers that require a complex series of forms will implement a conversation object. However, there are two built-in classes that provide the base functionality that implementers can build on. These are FormsConversationBase, used when validating Active Directory credentials is not required, and ExplicitConversation, used when validating Active Directory credentials is required.\n\n\nAn individual form is usually composed of two elements: the form object and the associated form template. The form object is responsible for generating a dynamic data model that is passed to the forms template engine with the name of the forms template to generate the form that will be transmitted to the client. The form object is also responsible for processing the response to the form generated by the client. Although StoreFront has a small number of built-in form objects and their associated templates, custom forms implementers will generally have to implement new forms objects and templates.\n\n\nThe forms template engine is the built-in component that can be used by individual forms to generate the final Receiver Common Form XML from a template and dynamic data. It is not expected that custom forms implementers will be required to modify this component.\n\n\nFormsConversationBase, used when validating Active Directory credentials is not required, and ExplicitConversation, used when validating Active Directory credentials is required.\n\n\nAn individual form is usually composed of two elements: the form object and the associated form template.

It is not expected that custom forms implementers will be required to modify this component.\n\n\nForm Conversation Factory\n\n\nIf a custom conversation is required, then a custom factory is required that implements the following interface:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.FormsProtocol.Conversations.Interfaces\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// This interface represents a factory for instances of \nseealso cref=\nIFormsConversation\n/\n\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public interface IFormsConversationFactory\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Create a new instance of an object that implements \nseealso cref=\nIFormsConversation\n/\n\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ncontrollerContext\n\n        /// The \nseealso cref=\nControllerContext\n/\n for where the conversation will be run\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ntemplateEngine\n\n        /// The \nseealso cref=\nFormsTemplateEngine\n/\n to use to render the conversation\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ncultures\nThe current language cultures\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\n\n        /// A new instance of an object that implements \nseealso cref=\nIFormsConversation\n/\n\n        /// \n/returns\n\n        IFormsConversation Create(ControllerContext controllerContext,\n                                  FormsTemplateEngine templateEngine,\n                                  IEnumerable\nCultureInfo\n cultures);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis factory must be stored in the IoC container with a specific name, and this is usually achieved through the use of a start-up module (see the StoreFront Service Authentication SDK for more details on start-up modules). The appropriate conversation engine obtains the factory name from the route data associated with the start of the customized conversation in the web.config file. For example, the following is the route data for the built-in user name and password conversation:\n\n\n    \nexplicitAuthentication\n\n      \nrouteTable order=\n0\n\n        \nroutes\n\n          \nroute name=\nStartExplicitAuthentication\n url=\nExplicitForms/Start\n\n            \ndefaults\n\n              \nadd param=\ncontroller\n value=\nExplicitFormsAuthentication\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\naction\n value=\nAuthenticateStart\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\npostbackAction\n value=\nAuthenticate\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\ncancelAction\n value=\nCancelAuthenticate\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\nconversationFactory\n value=\nExplicitAuthentication\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\nchangePasswordAction\n value=\nStartChangePassword\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\nchangePasswordController\n value=\nChangePassword\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\nprotocol\n value=\nExplicitForms\n /\n\n            \n/defaults\n\n            \ndata /\n\n          \n/route\n\n          \nroute name=\nExplicitAuthentication\n url=\nExplicitForms\n\n            \ndefaults\n\n              \nadd param=\ncontroller\n value=\nExplicitFormsAuthentication\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\naction\n value=\nAuthenticate\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\nprotocol\n value=\nExplicitForms\n /\n\n            \n/defaults\n\n            \ndata /\n\n          \n/route\n\n          \nroute name=\nCancelExplicitAuthentication\n url=\nExplicitForms/Cancel\n\n            \ndefaults\n\n              \nadd param=\ncontroller\n value=\nExplicitFormsAuthentication\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\naction\n value=\nCancelAuthenticate\n /\n\n              \nadd param=\nprotocol\n value=\nExplicitForms\n /\n\n            \n/defaults\n\n            \ndata /\n\n          \n/route\n\n        \n/routes\n\n      \n/routeTable\n\n    \n/explicitAuthentication\n\n\n\n\nThe conversation engine uses the service locator to obtain the factory object with the specified name and then invokes the Create() method to obtain the custom conversation object.\n\n\n\n\nForm Conversation\n\n\nMost new authentication conversations will require a conversation object to orchestrate the sequence of forms. The StoreFront Services Authentication SDK contains samples that demonstrate creating custom conversation objects.\n\n\nWhen a conversation is started, the first action is to create a ConversationState object that has the following API:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.FormsProtocol.Conversations\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// This data class contains the conversation state that is required\n    /// to be stored in the session state between requests.\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public class ConversationState\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Constructor\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public ConversationState()\n        {\n            Extensions = new Dictionary\nstring, object\n();\n        }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the \nseealso cref=\nFormsTemplateEngine\n/\n.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nremarks\n\n        /// This is used to render the forms that make up the conversation.\n        /// \n/remarks\n\n        public FormsTemplateEngine TemplateEngine { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the current \nseealso cref=\nIFormsConversation\n/\n\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public IFormsConversation CurrentConversation { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the \nseealso cref=\nRequestToken\n/\n message\n        /// sent at the start of the conversation.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nremarks\n\n        /// This is used to generate the request security token response\n        /// at the end of the conversation.\n        /// \n/remarks\n\n        public RequestToken RequestToken { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the \nseealso cref=\nITokenService\n/\n used to\n        /// issue the \nseealso cref=\nIToken\n/\n generated at the end\n        /// of the conversation.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public ITokenService TokenIssuingService { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets whether or not this conversation is delegated using the\n        /// delegated forms protocol\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public bool Delegated { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the \nseealso cref=\nIStringCipher\n/\n to use for the delegated result\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public IStringCipher Cipher { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets a dictionary of extension objects\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public Dictionary\nstring, object\n Extensions { get; private set; }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis object is used to store the state of the conversation between HTTP requests and responses. The conversation object is re-created for each HTTP request or response, so custom conversation implementers should not attempt to add member variables to their custom conversation class to store data. Implementers should instead store their custom data in the conversation state Extensions dictionary if they require the data to persist between HTTP requests or responses.\n\n\nA conversation object must implement the following interface:\n\n\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// This interface represents a Forms conversation, or part of a conversation\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public interface IFormsConversation\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Start the Form conversation\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nabsoluteBaseUrl\n\n        /// This is the absolute Url of the end-point to be used for\n        /// the conversation.\n        /// \n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nabsoluteCancelUrl\n\n        /// This is the absolute Url of the end-point to be used to\n        /// cancel the conversation.\n        /// \n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nhttpContext\nThe \nseealso cref=\nHttpContextBase\n/\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\n/returns\n\n        FormResult Start(string absoluteBaseUrl, string absoluteCancelUrl,\n                         HttpContextBase httpContext);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Cancel the current Form conversation\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nhttpContext\nThe \nseealso cref=\nHttpContextBase\n/\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\n/returns\n\n        FormResult Cancel(HttpContextBase httpContext);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Get the next form in the conversation.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nreturns\n/returns\n\n        RenderedForm GetNextForm();\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Process the response to form\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nhttpContext\n\n        /// The \nseealso cref=\nHttpContextBase\n/\n containing all the information\n        /// regarding the form response.\n        /// \n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nFormData\nThe Form data\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\n/returns\n\n        FormResult ProcessFormResponse(HttpContextBase httpContext, NameValueCollection FormData);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets the collection of credential types required for this conversation.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        IEnumerable\nstring\n RequiredCredentialTypes { get; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets the host-relative endpoint for this conversation.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        string Endpoint { get; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets the host-relative endpoint to cancel this conversation.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        string CancelEndpoint { get; }\n    }\n\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// Enumeration of Form results\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public enum FormResult\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// More information is required.

A form object is responsible for the generation of the specific Receiver Common Form XML for the task and the processing of the user agent\u2019s response. A form object may repeatedly generate XML forms until its task is complete, for example to re-prompt for a password and show an error message if the previously submitted password was incorrect.\n\n\nForms must implement the following interface:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Engine.Interfaces\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// The expected next action for the form\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public enum FormState\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Rendering the next form\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        Rendering,\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Processing the response to the last form\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        Processing,\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// This form is complete\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        Complete\n    };\n\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// This interface represents a single Form\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public interface IForm\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Render the next form.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe next \nseealso cref=\nRenderedForm\n/\n/returns\n\n        RenderedForm GetNextForm();\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Process the response to the last form\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nhttpContext\n\n        /// The \nseealso cref=\nHttpContextBase\n/\n containing all the information\n        /// regarding the form response.\n        /// \n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nformData\nThe form data.\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe \nseealso cref=\nFormResult\n/\n from processing the response\n/returns\n\n        FormResult ProcessFormResponse(HttpContextBase httpContext, NameValueCollection formData);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets the collection of credential types required for this conversation.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        IEnumerable\nstring\n RequiredCredentialTypes { get; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets the current state of the form\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        FormState State { get; }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nStoreFront Services contains a base class that implementers can inherit from:\n\n\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.FormsProtocol.Forms.FormBase\n\n\nThis class implements the basic required functionality, but the implementer must implement the following methods:\n\n\n        /// \nsummary\nRender the next form.\n/summary\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe next \nseealso cref=\nRenderedForm\n/\n/returns\n\n        public virtual RenderedForm GetNextForm()\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n        /// \nsummary\nProcess the response to the last form\n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nhttpContext\n\n        /// The \nseealso cref=\nHttpContextBase\n/\n containing all the information\n        /// regarding the form response.\n        /// \n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nformData\nThe form data\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe \nseealso cref=\nFormResult\n/\n from processing the response\n/returns\n\n        public virtual FormResult ProcessFormResponse(HttpContextBase httpContext,\n                                                      NameValueCollection formData)\n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException();\n        }\n\n\n\n\nThe GetNextForm() method may use the forms template engine, described below, to generate the Receiver Common Form XML to be sent to the client. Then RenderedForm returned has the following structure:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Engine.Interfaces\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// This data class represents a rendered form\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public class RenderedForm\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the rendered Form as an \nseealso cref=\nXmlDocument\n/\n\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public XmlDocument Form { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Get or sets whether the associated form is the last form\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public bool Complete { get; set; }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe Complete flag should be set to true if the form is not expecting the client to send a response back to the form being issued. This is usually required for terminal error messages, and will result in the conversation being terminated when the form has been sent to the client.\n\n\nIf the conversation returns FormResult.moreInfo to the Conversation Engine, then it will request the next form from the conversation object.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a form has completed its processing, ProcessFormResponse should return FormResult.success. This signals to the conversation object that it should now use the next form in the sequence.\n\n\n\n\nWhen all the forms have completed their processing, then the conversation is complete and the conversation returns FormResult.success to the conversation engine. This causes it to obtain the success result, which for non-delegated forms authentication is a Request Security Token Response message, which is returned to the client containing the access token.\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in Support\n\n\nThe StoreFront Authentication SDK has some built-in forms. It also provides access to the built-in support for verifying and managing Active Directory credentials.\n\n\nActive Directory\n\n\nThe Authentication Service IoC container is populated with several objects that can be used to verify and manage Active Directory credentials, and are described below:\n\n\nUser Name with Password Support\n\n\nThe IoC container is populated with an object that implements the following interface:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Explicit.Core\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// A class to be used to create an instance that implements \nseealso cref=\nIExplicit\n/\n.\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public class ExplicitFactory\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Initializes a new instance of the \nsee cref=\nExplicitFactory\n/\n class.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nexplicitSettings\n\n        /// The \nseealso cref=\nExplicitSettings\nexplicit settings\n/seealso\n\n        /// \n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nauthenticationSettings\n\n        /// The general \nseealso cref=\nAuthenticationSettings\n/\n\n        /// \n/param\n\n        public ExplicitFactory(ExplicitSettings explicitSettings,\n                               AuthenticationSettings authenticationSettings);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the \nseealso cref=\nExplicitSettings\n/\n\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public ExplicitSettings Settings { get; private set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the general \nseealso cref=\nAuthenticationSettings\n/\n\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public AuthenticationSettings AuthenticationSettings { get; private set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Create an instance that implements \nseealso cref=\nIExplicit\n/\n\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nreturns\nAn object that implements \nseealso cref=\nIExplicit\n/\n/returns\n\n        public IExplicit CreateInstance();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe built-in ExplicitConversationFactory uses this to create an object that provides the user name with password support.

Instead they will be asked for their user name in the form of domain\\user or user@domain.\n\n\nIf this value is false, then a domain user interface element will be displayed. If the \n element is empty, then a text box for the user to type their domain should be displayed, otherwise a combo box containing all the values from the \n element should be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallowUserPasswordChange: This value controls when a user is allowed to change their password and can have the following values:\n\n\nNever: The user is not allowed to change their password through StoreFront. A user attempting to authenticate with an expired password will fail to gain access to the system, and will be directed to change their password elsewhere.\n\n\nExpiredOnly: The user is allowed to change an expired password during the authentication process.\n\n\nAlways: The user can change an expired password during authentication, but will also receive a warning when their password is about to expire, and will be able to choose to change their password at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nallowZeroLengthPassword: This is usually false and prevents users with zero length passwords from gaining access to the system or changing their password to a zero length.\n\n\nshowPasswordExpiryWarning: This setting controls when a password expiry warning notice is presented to the user, if allowUserChangePassword=Always, and this setting can have the following values:\n\n\nWindows: The period is determined by the Windows setting described here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee829687(v=ws.10).aspx \n\n\nCustom: The period is determined by the passwordExpiryWarningPeriod setting below\n\n\nNever: The notification is never shown to the user\n\n\n\n\n\n\npasswordExpiryWarningPeriod: This setting, in days, determines when to display a password expiry warning notice to the user, if allowUserChangePassword=Always and showPasswordExpiryWarning=Custom\n\n\nrequireAccountSIDs: This setting determines whether or not to include the Windows Group information with the authentication data. This value should be left as true, as other StoreFront components rely on the information being present.\n\n\ndomainSelection: This element allows the specification of a set of domains. These can be specified as either short domain or fully qualified domain names. The user is then restricted to either selecting or typing a valid domain. It is possible to specify a default.\n\n\nNote: The comparison is a string comparison only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKerberos Support\n\n\nStoreFront also allows the use of Kerberos Service-For-User (S4U) for partial account validation and to obtain information about the account, including group information. The IoC container is populated with an object that implements the following interface that can be used for this purpose:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Kerberos\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// Interface for attempting kerberos authentication\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public interface IKerberosAuthenticator\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Authenticate the user specified by their user principal name\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nuserPrincipalName\nThe user principal name\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nclientRealm\nThe optional client realm \n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe \nseealso cref=\nAuthenticationResult\n/\n/returns\n\n        AuthenticationResult Authenticate(string userPrincipalName, string clientRealm = null);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Authenticate the user specified by a user certificate\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nuserCertificate\nThe user certificate\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ndomainHint\nThe optional domain hint \n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe \nseealso cref=\nAuthenticationResult\n/\n/returns\n\n        AuthenticationResult Authenticate(X509Certificate2 userCertificate,\n                                          string domainHint = null);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Authenticate the user specified by a user certificate\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nuserCertificate\nThe user certificate\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ndomainHint\nThe optional domain hint \n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe \nseealso cref=\nAuthenticationResult\n/\n/returns\n\n        AuthenticationResult Authenticate(HttpClientCertificate userCertificate,\n                                          string domainHint = null);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nForms\n\n\nThe Authentication SDK provides the following built-in forms:\n\n\nCancelledForm\n\n\nThis class creates the required form in response to a cancel request.\n\n\nConstructor:\n\n\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.FormsProtocol.Forms.CancelledForm(\n                  FormsTemplateEngine templateEngine, IEnumerable\nCultureInfo\n cultures)\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\n\ntemplateEngine: The template engine.

The templates are based on the ASP.NET Razor View Engine (see http://www.asp.net/web-pages/tutorials/basics/2-introduction-to-asp-net-web-programming-using-the-razor-syntax) with methods specific to the Receiver Common Forms domain that comprises the Forms Template Language described below.\n\n\nThe StoreFront Authentication SDK samples contain examples of how to define new templates, use the API, generate localized textual content, and use the Forms Template Language. Further details of the APIs can also be found in the XML documentation file at:\n\n\nAuthSDK.zip\\Assemblies\\StoreFront\\Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Template.XML\n\n\nIf there are issues with the template processing, the Forms Template Engine adds events to the Event log as described in Appendix A.\n\n\nCreation\n\n\nTemplate Engine Creation\n\n\nFor a particular web application, there is one and only one instance of the Forms Template Engine. It is stored in the StoreFront IoC container by the Forms Protocol start-up module during the application start-up and is accessed through the service locator.\n\n\nFirst a Razor engine host is created and configured to generate C# code. The base class is configured to be:\n\n\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Template.FormsTemplateBase\n\n\nThis base class contains the domain-specific business rules relating to the Citrix Receiver Common Forms.\n\n\nThe Razor host imports the following namespaces:\n\n\n\n\nSystem\n\n\nCitrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Template.Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nA limitation of this version is that it is not possible to add other namespaces or references to custom assemblies.\n\n\n\n\nThe Forms Template Engine is then constructed from a Razor template engine, wrapping the razor host and the Citrix localization factory, before loading and compiling the templates.\n\n\nThe templates are files with the file extension tfrm that are stored in the directory ~/App_Data/Templates. The template engine also finds and loads images with the following file extensions: gif, jpg, jpeg, png, bmp. The Forms Template Engine also watches for changes to the templates directory and automatically reloads the templates when a change is made. When the templates are reloaded, an event is added to the Citrix Delivery Services Event log, as described in Appendix A, with Event Id: 5. \n\n\nThe Forms Template Engine is finally stored in the IoC.\n\n\nTemplate Compilation\n\n\nThe compilation of a template, named CustomTemplate.tfrm for example, has the following steps:\n\n\n1.The Razor engine takes the template contents and generates code that represents the class Citrix.CompiledForms.CustomTemplate as C# code with FormsTemplateBase as its base class.\n\n\n2.The C# is then compiled into a code DOM using the CSharpCodeProvider.\n\n\n3.The code DOM is then compiled into an in-memory assembly that is loaded into the process.\n\n\n4.The loaded assembly is then stored in the Forms Template Engine, indexed as: CustomTemplate.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nThe Razor template processing requires that the process has write access to the %TEMP% directory\n\n\n\n\nTemplate Rendering\n\n\nImages\n\n\nThe Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language allows the use of images as part of the authentication process, for example Captcha images. In addition to the templates, the Forms Template Engine will also search the template folder for files with extensions: gif, jpg, jpeg, png, and bmp. It will load all the files found and convert them to appropriate RFC 2397 data URIs, ready for use in the required templates. Again, adding, removing, or modifying an image will result in the images being reloaded automatically.\n\n\nImages can also be dynamically generated, with support built-in for converting raw image data to data URIs for use in forms.\n\n\nLocalization\n\n\nThe forms Template Engine supports the generation of localized textual content from a single template. In order for localized content to be available to the Forms Template Engine, the forms author should create localized content as standard Microsoft resx files (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ekyft91f(v=vs.90).aspx). These resource files should be placed in the directory:\n\n\n~/App_Data/resources.\n\n\nStoreFront Services needs to be configured to become aware of new localization files, as described below.\n\n\nAPIs that accept localization keys can also accept either strings that do not require localization, or pre-localized strings. The processing of a localization key has the following steps.\n\n\nA key is expected to be an indexed resource key of form: ResourceSetPrefix:Key. The ResourceSetPrefix is configured in the Authentication Service web.config, and maps a prefix to a set of resources. For example, the default prefixes are defined as:\n\n\nconfiguration\n  \n  \ncitrix.deliveryservices\n\n    \nlocalisation\n\n      \nresourceSets\n\n        \nclear /\n\n        \nadd prefix=\nFormsProtocol\n resourcePath=\nApp_Data/resources/FormsProtocol\n /\n\n        \nadd prefix=\nExplicitCore\n resourcePath=\nApp_Data/resources/ExplicitCore\n /\n\n        \nadd prefix=\nExplicitFormsCommon\n resourcePath=\nApp_Data/resources/ExplicitFormsCommon\n /\n\n        \nadd prefix=\nExplicitAuth\n resourcePath=\nApp_Data/resources/ExplicitAuth\n /\n\n      \n/resourceSets\n\n    \n/localisation\n\n  \n/citrix.deliveryservices\n\n\n/configuration\n\n\n\n\nSo, for example, the resource named: \u201ctest\u201d defined in the FormsProtocol.resx file would be accessed by the localization key:\n\n\nFormsProtocol:test\n\n\nCustomizations are expected to update the above configuration with their resource sets.\n\n\nIf a localization key is supplied that does not correspond to this pattern, or that specifies a resource set prefix not mapped in the above configuration, then the supplied key is just returned as the localized string. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\u201cString not to be localized\u201d would be localized as: \u201cString not to be localized\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPre-localized\u201d would be localized as: \u201cPre-localized\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUnknownReseourceSetPrefix:Key\u201d would be localized as: \u201cUnknownReseourceSetPrefix:Key\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIf a valid resource set prefix is found, then the associated resource provider is used to locate the appropriate localized string into the requested language. If the localization key exists, but the request is to localize to a language not provided, then the string will be localized into the default language, which is English.\n\n\nTemplate Rendering\n\n\nThe Forms Template Engine is used by Forms objects to generate the Forms through the following methods on the Forms Template Engine:\n\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Render the specified template using the specified anonymous object\n        /// as the model.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ntemplateName\nThe name of the template to render\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ncurrentCultures\nThe current \nseealso cref=\nCultureInfo\n/\n to use to \n                                          localize text items\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nmodel\nThe anonymous model\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nmessages\nThe \nseealso cref=\nFormsMessage\n/\n to render\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe rendered Xml\n/returns\n\n        public XmlDocument RenderTemplate(string templateName,\n                                          IEnumerable\nCultureInfo\n currentCultures,\n                                          object model,\n                                          IEnumerable\nFormsMessage\n messages = null);\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Render the specified template using the specified dictionary of named objects\n        /// as the values.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ntemplateName\nThe name of the template to render\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\ncurrentCultures\nThe current \nseealso cref=\nCultureInfo\n/\n to use to \n                                          localize text items\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nrenderValues\nThe dictionary of named objects to use as values\n/param\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nmessages\nThe \nseealso cref=\nFormsMessage\n/\n to render\n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe rendered Xml\n/returns\n\n        public XmlDocument RenderTemplate(string templateName,\n                                          IEnumerable\nCultureInfo\n currentCultures,\n                                          IDictionary\nstring, object\n renderValues,\n                                          IEnumerable\nFormsMessage\n messages=null);\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, the template name is the index of the compiled template, as described above; for example, the name to be used for test.tfrm is: test. The data model, whether an anonymous data class or a dictionary, allows the form to define named data items referenced in the associated template. Examples of data models can be seen in the Forms Template Language section below.\n\n\nThe FormsMessage object has the following API, and is used for associating messages with credentials:\n\n\nnamespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Template.RequirementAPI\n{\n    /// \nsummary\n\n    /// This class represents a message to be displayed on a form.\n    /// The message is one of the following categories:\n    ///     information, warning or error.\n    /// \n/summary\n\n    public class FormsMessage\n    {\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the localization key\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public string LocalisationKey { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the localized message\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        internal string Message { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the collection of filed identifiers that this\n        /// message relates to.\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public IEnumerable\nstring\n FieldIds { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Gets or sets the form message type\n        /// This must be: information, warning or error\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        public Label.LabelType MessageType { get; set; }\n\n        /// \nsummary\n\n        /// Render this message into the specified buffer\n        /// \n/summary\n\n        /// \nparam name=\nsb\n\n        /// The \nseealso cref=\nStringBuilder\n/\n to render this message into\n        /// \n/param\n\n        /// \nreturns\nThe string of the the rendered message\n/returns\n\n        public void RenderMessageToBuffer(StringBuilder sb);\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor example, consider a change password form with a requirement for the user to re-enter their existing password:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nID\noldPassword\n/ID\n\n    \nType\npassword\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nOld password:\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nText\n\n      \nSecret\ntrue\n/Secret\n\n      \nReadOnly\nfalse\n/ReadOnly\n\n      \nInitialValue\n/InitialValue\n\n      \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n    \n/Text\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nIf the user enters an invalid value, then an error label is returned that specifies the oldPassword requirement to be highlighted. This would be done by creating a FormsMessage as follows:\n\n\nnew FormsMessage\n    {\n        MessageType = Label.LabelType.error,\n        LocalisationKey = \nExplicitCore:OldInvalid\n,\n        FieldIds = new[] { \noldPassword\n }\n    }\nThis would result in the following XML:\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nHighlightFields\n\n      \nCredentialID\noldPassword\n/CredentialID\n\n    \n/HighlightFields\n\n    \nText\nOld password incorrect\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nerror\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput /\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nThe generated form XML is returned to the client by the conversation engine and the MVC Controller in an appropriately formatted message.\n\n\nThe Authentication SDK samples contain detailed examples of how to use the Template Rendering API.\n\n\nForms Template Language\n\n\nThe FormsTemplateBase C# class has a collection of methods that can be accessed in the template. These form the domain- specific forms template language. The language is divided into three APIs: low-level, requirements and high-level, which allow different levels of control of the final Receiver Common Forms XML. Appendix B illustrates a single form generated using the three APIs, so that they can be compared and contrasted.\n\n\nThe following description expects a basic understanding of the layout of the Receiver Common Forms XML as described in [2]. The APIs also expect an understanding of C# optional and named Parameters, as described here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/dd264739.aspx \n\n\nIn addition to these domain-specific methods, many general Razor programming constructs may be used.\n\n\nLow Level API\n\n\nThis API is the lowest level API and is based around the generation of strings for XML documents.\n\n\nFor the low-level methods, all the Parameters are required.\n\n\nContainsValue\n\n\nbool ContainsValue(string valueName)\n\n\nThis method returns true if the specified named index is associated with an object in the data model.\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\n\nvalueName: The name of an object in the data model.\n\n\n\n\nReturns: True if the specified named index is valid\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nModel: new { AssistiveText = \"Help Text\"};\n\n\nTemplate:\n\n\nInput\n\n@if (ContainsValue(\nAssistiveText\n))\n{\n@: \nAssistiveText\n@GetValue(\nAssistiveText\n)\n/AssistiveText \n\n}\n  \nText\n\n    \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n  \n/Text\n\n\n/Input\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nInput\n\n  \nAssistiveText\nHelp Text\n/AssistiveText\n\n  \nText\n\n    \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n  \n/Text\n\n\n/Input\n\n\n\n\nGetObject\n\n\nobject GetObject(string valueName)\n\n\nThis method returns the object in the data model with the specified named index.\n\n\nParameters:\n:\n\n\n\n\nvalueName: The name of an object in the data model.\n\n\n\n\nReturns: The specified object from the data model, or null if the index is not valid.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nModel:\n\n\nnew\n{\n    PhoneNumbers = new []\n                   {\n                       new Tuple\nstring, string\n (\nHome Number\n, \n01954 283 710\n),\n                       new Tuple\nstring, string\n (\nFax Number\n, \n01954 283 601\n)\n                   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTemplate:\n\n\n@foreach(Tuple\nstring, string\n phoneNumber in (IEnumerable)GetObject(\nPhoneNumbers\n))\n{\n@:      \nRequirement\n\n@Credential(credentialType: \nnone\n)\n@TextLabel(labelKey: @phoneNumber.Item1)\n@:        \nInput\n\n@:          \nText\n\n@:            \nInitialValue\n@phoneNumber.Item2\n/InitialValue\n\n@:            \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n@:          \n/Text\n\n@:        \n/Input\n\n@:      \n/Requirement\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nHome Number\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nText\n\n      \nInitialValue\n01954 283 710\n/InitialValue\n\n      \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n    \n/Text\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\nRequirement\n\n  \nCredential\n\n    \nType\nnone\n/Type\n\n  \n/Credential\n\n  \nLabel\n\n    \nText\nFax Number\n/Text\n\n    \nType\nplain\n/Type\n\n  \n/Label\n\n  \nInput\n\n    \nText\n\n      \nInitialValue\n01954 283 601\n/InitialValue\n\n      \nConstraint\n.+\n/Constraint\n\n    \n/Text\n\n  \n/Input\n\n\n/Requirement\n\n\n\n\nGetValue\n\n\nstring GetValue(string valueName)\n\n\nThis method returns the object in the data model with the specified named index, as a string.

            "text": "Citrix has devised a common authentication protocol that is implemented by its next generation services and gateway platforms, referred to here as StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway. Citrix has implemented client support for this common authentication protocol in native user agents, such as Receiver and Worx, for the major device platforms, notably Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Receiver for Web for browser-based user agents.  An important part of the common authentication protocol is a generic forms language, which is described in the Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language document [2]. This language is designed to allow third parties to express a wide range of authentication forms using a set of user interface constructs that are similar to basic HTML forms; see RFC 1867 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1867.txt] and 2388 [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2388.txt] for more details.  Third parties can extend the authentication methods supported by StoreFront Services and NetScaler Gateway by implementing server logic that emits and consumes forms defined in the common forms language; see the Citrix Authentication Software Development Kit [1] for more details.  This document aims to enable Citrix partners to understand how StoreFront generates the formsand to enable them to customize the existing form definitions, create new forms, and new sequences of forms to create new authentication conversations.",

            "text": "Forms-based authentication is a conversation using the HTTP protocol where the client responds to a series of forms generated by the server to establish an identity on the server. The HTTP API is described in the Citrix Common Forms API document [3]. There are several StoreFront components that interact to achieve the generation of the forms and the handling of the HTTP responses.   StoreFront makes extensive use of service location and inversion-of-control (IoC) containers; see http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html for more details of this software pattern.   Forms Generation Components for a conversation requiring Active Directory credential validation  Handling HTTP requests and responses is the responsibility of a small set of built-in MVCs (model view controllers). In most cases there will be no need for custom form implementers to implement new controllers. For general forms, where there is no requirement to validate Active Directory credentials, the FormsAuthenticationController ASP.Net MVC controller should be used. If validating Active Directory credentials is required, then the ExplicitFormsAuthenticationController controller should be used. The MVC controllers validate the requests and extract the state associated with the conversation and then construct and invoke the conversation engine.  The conversation engine is responsible for running the conversation, which includes creating the appropriate conversation object and dispatching messages to it. There are two built-in conversation engines: ConversationEngine, used when validating Active Directory credentials is not required, and ExplicitConversationEngine, used when validating Active Directory credentials is required. Again, it is not anticipated that custom forms implementers will need to modify the conversation engine functionality.  The configuration for the MVC route includes the name, used by the Service Locator to find a class that implements the IFormsConversationFactory interface, stored in the IoC container. The appropriate conversation engine uses this to locate the custom conversation factory that uses any settings required, to create a new custom conversation object.  The custom conversation object is responsible for orchestrating the sequence of forms and dispatching messages to appropriate form objects. It is expected that custom forms implementers that require a complex series of forms will implement a conversation object. However, there are two built-in classes that provide the base functionality that implementers can build on. These are FormsConversationBase, used when validating Active Directory credentials is not required, and ExplicitConversation, used when validating Active Directory credentials is required.  An individual form is usually composed of two elements: the form object and the associated form template. The form object is responsible for generating a dynamic data model that is passed to the forms template engine with the name of the forms template to generate the form that will be transmitted to the client. The form object is also responsible for processing the response to the form generated by the client. Although StoreFront has a small number of built-in form objects and their associated templates, custom forms implementers will generally have to implement new forms objects and templates.  The forms template engine is the built-in component that can be used by individual forms to generate the final Receiver Common Form XML from a template and dynamic data. It is not expected that custom forms implementers will be required to modify this component.

The StoreFront Services Authentication SDK contains samples that demonstrate creating custom conversation objects.  When a conversation is started, the first action is to create a ConversationState object that has the following API:  namespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.FormsProtocol.Conversations\n{\n    ///  summary \n    /// This data class contains the conversation state that is required\n    /// to be stored in the session state between requests.\n    ///  /summary \n    public class ConversationState\n    {\n        ///  summary \n        /// Constructor\n        ///  /summary \n        public ConversationState()\n        {\n            Extensions = new Dictionary string, object ();\n        }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the  seealso cref= FormsTemplateEngine / .\n        ///  /summary \n        ///  remarks \n        /// This is used to render the forms that make up the conversation.\n        ///  /remarks \n        public FormsTemplateEngine TemplateEngine { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the current  seealso cref= IFormsConversation / \n        ///  /summary \n        public IFormsConversation CurrentConversation { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the  seealso cref= RequestToken /  message\n        /// sent at the start of the conversation.\n        ///  /summary \n        ///  remarks \n        /// This is used to generate the request security token response\n        /// at the end of the conversation.\n        ///  /remarks \n        public RequestToken RequestToken { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the  seealso cref= ITokenService /  used to\n        /// issue the  seealso cref= IToken /  generated at the end\n        /// of the conversation.\n        ///  /summary \n        public ITokenService TokenIssuingService { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets whether or not this conversation is delegated using the\n        /// delegated forms protocol\n        ///  /summary \n        public bool Delegated { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the  seealso cref= IStringCipher /  to use for the delegated result\n        ///  /summary \n        public IStringCipher Cipher { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets a dictionary of extension objects\n        ///  /summary \n        public Dictionary string, object  Extensions { get; private set; }\n    }\n}  This object is used to store the state of the conversation between HTTP requests and responses. The conversation object is re-created for each HTTP request or response, so custom conversation implementers should not attempt to add member variables to their custom conversation class to store data. Implementers should instead store their custom data in the conversation state Extensions dictionary if they require the data to persist between HTTP requests or responses.

Instead they will be asked for their user name in the form of domain\\user or user@domain.  If this value is false, then a domain user interface element will be displayed. If the   element is empty, then a text box for the user to type their domain should be displayed, otherwise a combo box containing all the values from the   element should be displayed.    allowUserPasswordChange: This value controls when a user is allowed to change their password and can have the following values:  Never: The user is not allowed to change their password through StoreFront. A user attempting to authenticate with an expired password will fail to gain access to the system, and will be directed to change their password elsewhere.  ExpiredOnly: The user is allowed to change an expired password during the authentication process.  Always: The user can change an expired password during authentication, but will also receive a warning when their password is about to expire, and will be able to choose to change their password at any time.    allowZeroLengthPassword: This is usually false and prevents users with zero length passwords from gaining access to the system or changing their password to a zero length.  showPasswordExpiryWarning: This setting controls when a password expiry warning notice is presented to the user, if allowUserChangePassword=Always, and this setting can have the following values:  Windows: The period is determined by the Windows setting described here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee829687(v=ws.10).aspx   Custom: The period is determined by the passwordExpiryWarningPeriod setting below  Never: The notification is never shown to the user    passwordExpiryWarningPeriod: This setting, in days, determines when to display a password expiry warning notice to the user, if allowUserChangePassword=Always and showPasswordExpiryWarning=Custom  requireAccountSIDs: This setting determines whether or not to include the Windows Group information with the authentication data. This value should be left as true, as other StoreFront components rely on the information being present.  domainSelection: This element allows the specification of a set of domains. These can be specified as either short domain or fully qualified domain names. The user is then restricted to either selecting or typing a valid domain. It is possible to specify a default.

It is stored in the StoreFront IoC container by the Forms Protocol start-up module during the application start-up and is accessed through the service locator.  First a Razor engine host is created and configured to generate C# code. The base class is configured to be:  Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Template.FormsTemplateBase  This base class contains the domain-specific business rules relating to the Citrix Receiver Common Forms.  The Razor host imports the following namespaces:   System  Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Template.Requirements    Notes  A limitation of this version is that it is not possible to add other namespaces or references to custom assemblies.   The Forms Template Engine is then constructed from a Razor template engine, wrapping the razor host and the Citrix localization factory, before loading and compiling the templates.  The templates are files with the file extension tfrm that are stored in the directory ~/App_Data/Templates. The template engine also finds and loads images with the following file extensions: gif, jpg, jpeg, png, bmp. The Forms Template Engine also watches for changes to the templates directory and automatically reloads the templates when a change is made. When the templates are reloaded, an event is added to the Citrix Delivery Services Event log, as described in Appendix A, with Event Id: 5.   The Forms Template Engine is finally stored in the IoC.",

In order for localized content to be available to the Forms Template Engine, the forms author should create localized content as standard Microsoft resx files (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ekyft91f(v=vs.90).aspx). These resource files should be placed in the directory:  ~/App_Data/resources.  StoreFront Services needs to be configured to become aware of new localization files, as described below.  APIs that accept localization keys can also accept either strings that do not require localization, or pre-localized strings. The processing of a localization key has the following steps.  A key is expected to be an indexed resource key of form: ResourceSetPrefix:Key. The ResourceSetPrefix is configured in the Authentication Service web.config, and maps a prefix to a set of resources. For example, the default prefixes are defined as:  configuration   \n   citrix.deliveryservices \n     localisation \n       resourceSets \n         clear / \n         add prefix= FormsProtocol  resourcePath= App_Data/resources/FormsProtocol  / \n         add prefix= ExplicitCore  resourcePath= App_Data/resources/ExplicitCore  / \n         add prefix= ExplicitFormsCommon  resourcePath= App_Data/resources/ExplicitFormsCommon  / \n         add prefix= ExplicitAuth  resourcePath= App_Data/resources/ExplicitAuth  / \n       /resourceSets \n     /localisation \n   /citrix.deliveryservices  /configuration  So, for example, the resource named: \u201ctest\u201d defined in the FormsProtocol.resx file would be accessed by the localization key:  FormsProtocol:test  Customizations are expected to update the above configuration with their resource sets.  If a localization key is supplied that does not correspond to this pattern, or that specifies a resource set prefix not mapped in the above configuration, then the supplied key is just returned as the localized string. Examples include:   \u201cString not to be localized\u201d would be localized as: \u201cString not to be localized\u201d  \u201cPre-localized\u201d would be localized as: \u201cPre-localized\u201d  \u201cUnknownReseourceSetPrefix:Key\u201d would be localized as: \u201cUnknownReseourceSetPrefix:Key\u201d   If a valid resource set prefix is found, then the associated resource provider is used to locate the appropriate localized string into the requested language. If the localization key exists, but the request is to localize to a language not provided, then the string will be localized into the default language, which is English.",

The data model, whether an anonymous data class or a dictionary, allows the form to define named data items referenced in the associated template. Examples of data models can be seen in the Forms Template Language section below.  The FormsMessage object has the following API, and is used for associating messages with credentials:  namespace Citrix.DeliveryServices.Authentication.Forms.Template.RequirementAPI\n{\n    ///  summary \n    /// This class represents a message to be displayed on a form.\n    /// The message is one of the following categories:\n    ///     information, warning or error.\n    ///  /summary \n    public class FormsMessage\n    {\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the localization key\n        ///  /summary \n        public string LocalisationKey { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the localized message\n        ///  /summary \n        internal string Message { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the collection of filed identifiers that this\n        /// message relates to.\n        ///  /summary \n        public IEnumerable string  FieldIds { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Gets or sets the form message type\n        /// This must be: information, warning or error\n        ///  /summary \n        public Label.LabelType MessageType { get; set; }\n\n        ///  summary \n        /// Render this message into the specified buffer\n        ///  /summary \n        ///  param name= sb \n        /// The  seealso cref= StringBuilder /  to render this message into\n        ///  /param \n        ///  returns The string of the the rendered message /returns \n        public void RenderMessageToBuffer(StringBuilder sb);\n    }\n}  For example, consider a change password form with a requirement for the user to re-enter their existing password:  Requirement \n   Credential \n     ID oldPassword /ID \n     Type password /Type \n   /Credential \n   Label \n     Text Old password: /Text \n     Type plain /Type \n   /Label \n   Input \n     Text \n       Secret true /Secret \n       ReadOnly false /ReadOnly \n       InitialValue /InitialValue \n       Constraint .+ /Constraint \n     /Text \n   /Input  /Requirement  If the user enters an invalid value, then an error label is returned that specifies the oldPassword requirement to be highlighted. This would be done by creating a FormsMessage as follows:  new FormsMessage\n    {\n        MessageType = Label.LabelType.error,\n        LocalisationKey =  ExplicitCore:OldInvalid ,\n        FieldIds = new[] {  oldPassword  }\n    }\nThis would result in the following XML: Requirement \n   Credential \n     Type none /Type \n   /Credential \n   Label \n     HighlightFields \n       CredentialID oldPassword /CredentialID \n     /HighlightFields \n     Text Old password incorrect /Text \n     Type error /Type \n   /Label \n   Input /  /Requirement  The generated form XML is returned to the client by the conversation engine and the MVC Controller in an appropriately formatted message.

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis sample for the StoreFront Authentication SDK demonstrates how to create and add a new authentication protocol, CertificateIdentityDeclaration, to StoreFront.\nThis protocol allows a client to send a certificate to the server to identify a user, without providing proof that it has access to the associated private key. The service uses the built-in Kerberos S4U support to map this certificate to an account, verify the account, and extract the group information associated with the account. An identification-level token is then constructed that can be used to launch a session where the user has to fully authenticate to gain access.\n\n\nInstaller\n\n\nIn common with the other samples, a pre-built installer is provided in addition to the source code.\nBefore attempting to deploy the pre-built sample installers, it is required to add the certificate at AuthSDK.zip/Certificates/YourCompany.cer to the Third-Party Root Certification Authorities store of the Local Computer account where StoreFront is installed. This is not required for the development machine. If this step is not completed, then the StoreFront Administration Console will display an error because the digital signature of the PowerShell modules associated with this customization will fail to verify.\nThe installer verifies that there is not an existing customization that implements CertificateIdentityDeclaration before deploying the StoreFront Feature package and the add-ins to the administration console. To actually deploy and enable a sample the \u201cAdd/Remove Methods\u201d action from the \u201cAuthentication\u201d node of the StoreFront Administration Console should be used.\nBefore attempting to uninstall a sample, the associated authentication method must first be removed using the \u201cAdd/Remove Methods\u201d action. If this is not done, attempting to uninstall will result in a dialog informing the administrator that the feature should be removed using the StoreFront Administration Console first. The sample can then be removed by using the standard \u201cAdd/Remove Programs\u201d control panel applet.\n\n\nCode Sample\n\n\nVisual Studio Solution Layout\n\n\nThe Certificate Identity Declaration solution is composed of five projects:\n\n\n\n\nFeature contains the code that will be added to the Authentication Service to control the authentication process, including the ASP.Net MVC Controller that manages the authentication protocol.\n\n\nConsole.Extension contains the code for the administration console, including the data models, action handlers, business logic, and user interface elements.\n\n\nInstaller is a WiX project to create an msi installer to deploy and remove the Certificate Identity Declaration Feature.\n\n\nInstaller.CustomActions contains the msi custom actions required to deploy and remove the Certificate Identity Declaration Feature.\n\n\nUnitTests contains some simple unit tests to verify the merging of the code into the authentication service, and to verify the behavior of the Service Locator.\n\n\n\n\nThis sample does not require any configuration, and so does not contain a configuration project or a StoreFront Administration Console View Extension. It also requires no custom deployment steps or PowerShell commands and so does not have a Feature Installer project.\nAll the projects target the .NET Framework 4.5 and the MSIL platform, unless specifically stated. Projects that target .NET Framework 3.5 are either part of the StoreFront Administration Console, or loaded by the Console. The rationale behind this is discussed in the StoreFront Service Authentication SDK document.\n\n\nFeature Project\n\n\nThis C# class library project contains a new ASP.MVC Controller for handling the HTTP request and response. The protocol specifies a single request/response pattern that is handled by the Declare() method in the Controller, which performs the following:\n\n\n\n\nVerify that the HTTP verb is POST\n\n\nVerify that the request is an RST\n\n\nVerify that the client accepts an RSTR response\n\n\nVerify that the CertificateIdentityDeclaration protocol is enabled\n\n\nVerify that there is a token-issuing service to issue the token\n\n\nVerify that a certificate can be extracted from the required header\n\n\nUse the built-in Kerberos authenticator to validate the certificate\n\n\nOptionally, log the authentication result\n\n\nCreate and return an RSTR message\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, there are classes following the standard pattern for logging and tracing to aid with diagnostics.\n\n\nConsole.Extension Project\n\n\nThis C# class library project is responsible for:\n\n\n\n\nProviding the localized authentication method name in the StoreFront Administration Console\n\n\nProviding a single, fixed, status message in the StoreFront Administration Console\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nThis project is targeted at .NET Framework 3.5, because it will be loaded by the StoreFront Administration Console.\n\n\n\n\nInstaller Project\n\n\nThis WiX project is responsible for the following:\n- Creating the CertificateIdentityDeclaration StoreFront Feature Package\n- Creating an installer to:\n    - Deploy the Feature Package\n    - Deploy the StoreFront Administration Console extension\n    - Update the registry so that the StoreFront Administration Console will load the extension\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\nThis project is targeted at the x64 platform\n\n\n\n\nInstaller.CustomActions Project\n\n\nThis C# class library project uses the standard pattern, as described in the StoreFront Authentication SDK document, with the Feature identifier and Authentication Protocol Name set to appropriate values for this customization.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nThis project is targeted at .NET Framework 3.5.\n\n\nThis project is targeted at the x64 platform to ensure that it has access to the correct registry locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit Tests Project\n\n\nThis project contains standard: web.config merge and unmerge, route, and protocol choice tests, in addition to tests of the protocol in terms of HTTP request and responses.\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nThis section describes the HTTP-based protocol to use to declare a user identity with a certificate.\n\n\nEnd Point\n\n\n\n\nURL: /CertificateIdentityDeclaration\n\n\nHTTP Method: POST\n\n\nAuthentication: None\n\n\nRequest Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\n\n\nResponse Content-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml\n\n\n\n\nThe client presents the certificate associated with the user with the following header:\nX-Citrix-AM-ClientCertificateDeclaration: \n\nThe data is the result of exporting the public certificate in one of the following formats: Base64-encoded, DER-encoded X.509 certificate, or a PFX/PKCS12 certificate, before base-64 encoding the resulting data.\n\n\nWire Level\n\n\nThe following  \u201cwire-level\u201d example shows all the HTTP requests and responses when a client attempts to access a protected service (the resources service) and has to obtain security tokens to be granted access.\n\n\nRequest to Service Provider\n\n\nGET https://www.example.com/resources/v2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.resources+xml\n\n\n\n\nResponse from Service Provider\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nCache-Control: public, no-store, max-age=0\nWWW-Authenticate: CitrixAuth realm=\n6b78ab94-a709-4e3a-8b9b-a49ca317c70c\n,\n                             reqtokentemplate=\n, reason=\nnotoken\n,\n                             locations=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n,\n                             serviceroot-hint=https://www.example.com/Citrix/Store/resources/v2\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the client has to take the information provided in the CitrixAuth challenge and construct a Request for Security Token message to be POSTed to the URL specified in the challenge.\n\n\nRequest to Authentication Service\n\n\nPOST https://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml, application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenchoices+xml\nContent-Encoding: utf-8\nHost: www.example.com\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttoken xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttoken\n\n  \nfor-service\n6b78ab94-a709-4e3a-8b9b-a49ca317c70c\n/for-service\n\n  \nfor-service-url\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Store/resources/v2\n/for-service-url\n\n  \nreqtokentemplate /\n\n  \nrequested-lifetime\n1.06:00:00\n/requested-lifetime\n\n\n/requesttoken\n\n\n\n\nResponse from Service Provider\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nCache-Control: public, no-store, max-age=0\nWWW-Authenticate: CitrixAuth realm=\n32f585f3-054d-4ee5-a714-b0e11e312308\n,\n                     reqtokentemplate=\n, reason=\nnotoken\n   \n                     locations=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/protocols\n,\n                     serviceroot-hint=\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n\n\n\n\nHence, the result of this sequence is another challenge, because the client has not presented the security token required to access the token issuing service. The client must therefore, again, parse the challenge to construct another Request Security Token message and POST it to the indicated Uri, as follows:\n\n\nRequest to Authentication Service\n\n\nPOST https://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/protocols HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml, application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenchoices+xml\nContent-Encoding: utf-8\nHost: www.example.com\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttoken xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttoken\n\n  \nfor-service\n32f585f3-054d-4ee5-a714-b0e11e312308\n/for-service\n\n  \nfor-service-url\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n/for-service-url\n\n  \nreqtokentemplate /\n\n  \nrequested-lifetime\n1.06:00:00\n/requested-lifetime\n\n\n/requesttoken\n\nResponse from Service Provider\nHTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices\nCache-Control: public, no-store, max-age=0\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenchoices+xml\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttokenchoices xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttokenchoices\n\n  \nchoices\n\n    \nchoice\n\n      \nprotocol\nExplicitForms\n/protocol\n\n      \nlocation\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/ExplicitForms/Authenticate\n/location\n\n    \n/choice\n\n    \nchoice\n\n      \nprotocol\nCertificateIdentityDeclaration\n/protocol\n\n      \nlocation\n\n           https://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/CertificateIdentityDeclaration\n      \n/location\n\n    \n/choice\n\n  \n/choices\n\n\n/requesttokenchoices\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the authentication service has responded with a HTTP 300 (Multiple Choices) response, indicating that the security token can be obtained from a choice of URIs. In this case, each choice represents a different authentication protocol.\nThe client has been configured with a plug-in that knows how to perform CertificateIdentityDeclaration authentication, and so chooses that method by sending the RST to the specified endpoint, as illustrated below:\n\n\nRequest to Certificate Identity Declaration End-point\n\n\nPOST https://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/CertificateIdentityDeclaration HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttoken+xml\nAccept: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml\nX-Citrix-AM-ClientCertificateDeclaration: \nBase64EncodedData\n\nHost: www.example.com\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttoken xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttoken\n\n  \nfor-service\n32f585f3-054d-4ee5-a714-b0e11e312308\n/for-service\n\n  \nfor-service-url\nhttps://www.example.com/Citrix/Authentication/auth/v1/token\n/for-service-url\n\n  \nreqtokentemplate /\n\n  \nrequested-lifetime\n1.06:00:00\n/requested-lifetime\n\n\n/requesttoken\n\n\n\n\nIf the certificate represents a valid user, then the server responds with a Request Token Response, as follows:\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: no-cache; private; no-store; must-revalidate; max-stale=0; post-check=0;\n               pre-check=0; max-age=0\nContent-Type: application/vnd.citrix.requesttokenresponse+xml\nContent-Length: xxx\n\n\n?xml version=\n1.0\n encoding=\nutf-8\n?\n\n\nrequesttokenresponse xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/delivery-services/1-0/auth/requesttokenresponse\n\n  \nfor-service\n32f585f3-054d-4ee5-a714-b0e11e312308\n/for-service\n\n  \nissued\n2012-06-12T09:50:53.8436039Z\n/issued\n\n  \nexpiry\n2012-06-13T05:50:53.8436039Z\n/expiry\n\n  \nlifetime\n0.20:00:00\n/lifetime\n\n  \ntoken-template /\n\n  \ntoken\nH4sIAAAAAAAEAO29B2AcSZYlJi9tynt/Sv8Id/T8DXarOsQ4AAA==\n/token\n\n  \nCredentialUpdateInformationList xmlns=\nhttp://citrix.com/authentication/response/1\n\n    \nCredentialUpdateInformation\n\n      \nCredentialDisplayName\nexample.com\n/CredentialDisplayName\n\n      \nAuthenticationInfoId\nCitrix Common Forms 1.0\n/AuthenticationInfoId\n\n      \nCredentialUpdateService /\n\n    \n/CredentialUpdateInformation\n\n  \n/CredentialUpdateInformationList\n\n\n/requesttokenresponse\n\n\n\n\nThe client can then use this token to obtain a token to gain access for the resources service.",

This is not required for the development machine. If this step is not completed, then the StoreFront Administration Console will display an error because the digital signature of the PowerShell modules associated with this customization will fail to verify.\nThe installer verifies that there is not an existing customization that implements CertificateIdentityDeclaration before deploying the StoreFront Feature package and the add-ins to the administration console.

As described in the StoreFront Services Authentication SDK document, this protocol will be advertised to the clients as: CustomForms. The clients are required to recognize this protocol identifier and map it to their existing Common Forms rendering. Clients will give preference to this new protocol over the existing ExplicitForms protocol, should both be available.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOnly one authentication method can be deployed that advertises itself with a specific protocol choice name. Because Forms customizations rely on being advertised as CustomForms, this means that only one Forms customization can be installed on a StoreFront server.\n\n\n\n\nThis sample is a simple two-factor authentication protocol where the user has to supply both their password and a fixed \u201cmagic word\u201d, as illustrated below in Receiver for Windows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample also demonstrates:\n\n\n\n\nHow to extend the StoreFront Administration Console to add an action item that displays User Interface elements for configuring the protocol properties\n\n\nHow to configure the \u201cMagic Word\u201d that users must supply, and whether or not the protocol is split over two forms or displayed as a single form.\n\n\n\n\nIf the StoreFront Administration Console is opened after deploying this sample, selecting the \u201cAdd/Remove Methods\u201d action for the Authentication node, the following is displayed, including the \u201cMagic Word\u201d authentication method:\n\n\n\n\nSelecting the \u201cUser name, password, and magic word\u201d method will deploy and enable the method. Selecting the method in the console displays the actions associated with the method.\n\n\n\n\nThe required \u201cmagic word\u201d settings can be configured by selecting the Manage Magic Word action item in the context area for this authentication method, which brings up the following dialog:\n\n\n\n\nInstaller\n\n\nIn common with the other samples, a pre-built installer is provided in addition to the source code.\n\n\nBefore attempting to deploy the pre-built sample installers, it is required to add the certificate at AuthSDK.zip/Certificates/YourCompany.cer to the Third-Party Root Certification Authorities store of the Local Computer account where StoreFront is installed. This is not required for the development machine. If this step is not completed, then the StoreFront Administration Console will display an error because the digital signature of the PowerShell modules associated with this customization will fail to verify.\n\n\nThe installer verifies that there is not an existing customization that implements CustomForms before deploying the StoreFront Feature package and the add-ins to the administration console. To actually deploy and enable a sample the \u201cAdd/Remove Methods\u201d action from the \u201cAuthentication\u201d node of the StoreFront Administration Console should be used.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf the installer is being deployed to a StoreFront Server Group, it must be run on all servers in the group.\n\n\n\n\nBefore attempting to uninstall a sample, the associated authentication method must first be removed using the \u201cAdd/Remove Methods\u201d action. If this is not done, attempting to uninstall will result in a dialog informing the administratorthat the feature should be removed using the StoreFront Administration Console first.

If this step is not completed, then the StoreFront Administration Console will display an error because the digital signature of the PowerShell modules associated with this customization will fail to verify.  The installer verifies that there is not an existing customization that implements CustomForms, before deploying the StoreFront Feature package and the add-ins to the administration console. To actually deploy and enable a sample the \u201cAdd/Remove Methods\u201d action from the \u201cAuthentication\u201d node of the StoreFront Administration Console should be used.   Note  If the installer is being deployed to a StoreFront Server Group, it must be run on all servers in the group.   Before attempting to uninstall a sample, the associated authentication method must first be removed using the \u201cAdd/Remove Methods\u201d action. If this is not done, attempting to uninstall will result in a dialog informing the administrator that the feature should be removed using the StoreFront Administration Console first. The sample can then be removed by using the standard \u201cAdd/Remove Programs\u201d control panel applet.",

Installer is a WiX project to create an msi installer to deploy and remove the Test Forms Feature. It also contains the StoreFront Feature Package definition and builds the Feature Package.  Installer.CustomActions contains the msi custom actions required to deploy and remove the Test Forms Feature.  UnitTests contains some unit tests to verify the merging of the code and configuration into the authentication service, verify the behavior of the Service Locator, and verify the behavior of the authentication conversation.
